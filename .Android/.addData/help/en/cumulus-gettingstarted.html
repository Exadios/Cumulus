	<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Getting Started</H3>

	<P>To take full advantage of Cumulus, you need a PDA with either an
		internal or an external GPS receiver and a set of map files. Currently
		Cumulus supports the following hardware devices:</P>
		
		<ul>
    <li> Android devices up release level 2.2.x (FroYo)</li>
		<li> The Nokia Internet Tablets N800/N810 with Maemo OS2008</li>
		<li> The Nokia Internet Tablet N900 with Maemo OS2009</li>
		<li> Linux desktop devices, e.g. Ubuntu</li>
		</ul>

	<P>When you start Cumulus, it will create all the necessary data
		directories by itself, if they do not already exist. Furthermore you
		will be asked once whether you want to download missing airfield or
		map files from the Internet. Your decision is valid until to the
		termination of the program. If Cumulus is moving faster than 5 km/h,
		no downloads are executed. Only enable the automatic download if you
		have an active Internet connection running!</P>

		<DD>
			As long as the program runs on the PDA and you are on the move, the
			automatic shut-down of the screen to save battery life is
			deactivated. If you move slower than 5 km/h, the screen is switched
			off after your programmed time. If you then move faster, the screen
			is automatically switched on again. The speed limit can be configured
			in the <A HREF="cumulus-settings-look-feel.html#Screensaver">Look&amp;Feel</A>
			settings. <BR>For operation over several hours you need to
			supply external power to your PDA. Furthermore, it is recommended
			that you switch off all automatic connection or update attempts
			(WLAN, version updates, ...) before take-off, as these can rob
			Cumulus of resources, slowing it down for a while and irritating you
			with popup dialogs.

			<B>GPS</B>
		</DT>

		<DD>
			Any external GPS receiver, such as a Bluetooth GPS mouse or a flight
			logger, provided that it outputs NMEA data records, can be connected
			to your PDA, using either a serial, a USB or a Bluetooth connection.
			Cumulus can be used without a GPS receiver, but is far more useful
			with it.<BR>Once you manage to connect your GPS to Cumulus,
			select the correct device and baud rate in the <A
				HREF="cumulus-settings-gps.html">GPS Settings</A>. Refer to your GPS
			manual for the correct settings. The most common devices are:

			<p>
			<UL>
				<LI><I>/dev/ttyS0</I> - RS232 serial device</LI>
				<LI><I>/dev/rfcomm0</I> - Bluetooth device</LI>
				<LI><I>/dev/ttyUSB0</I> - USB device</LI>
			</UL>
			</p>

			The default NMEA connection speed is 4800 bps on a RS232 serial
			channel. <BR>
			<BR>If you have a Nokia Internet Tablet N800/N810 or N900, it is
			not necessary to set up a special GPS device. Available devices will
			be recognized automatically during Cumulus start-up, unless you want
			to connect to a GPS device via USB. In this case you have to select
			the USB device from the GPS configuration options. <BR>
			<BR>If you have an Android device with a built in GPS nothing
			has to be setup. To external GPS devices is only a connection
			possible via Bluetooth radio. <b>Note the following exception!</b>
			After every startup of Cumulus under Android the GPS receiving <b>must
				be enabled by hand</b>. To do that press the Android menu key, select
			the entry <i>GPS on</i> and choose the desired device (internal or
			Bluetooth). Bluetooth devices must be paired before Cumulus is
			started. Cumulus does not support BT pairing! <BR>
			<BR>Once your GPS device is set up, press the key <I><B>G</B></I>
			or click on the GPS status indicator in the status bar to check the
			GPS status. You can remove the GPS status page with the Escape key or
			with the close button.

			<B>Personal</B>
		</DT>

		<DD>
			In Personal Settings you define the coordinates of your home position
			in the area in which you fly. The setting is important to ensure an
			unskewed map rendering! See <A HREF="cumulus-settings-personal.html">Personal
				Settings</A> for more details.
		</DD>

		<DT>
			<B>Glider</B>
		</DT>

		<DD>
			Define your preferred gliders in Glider Settings. See <A
				HREF="cumulus-settings-glider.html">Glider Settings</A> for more
			details.
		</DD>

		<DT>
			<B>Maps</B>
		</DT>

		<DD>
			Cumulus uses the same maps as <I>KFLog,</I> the KDE Flight Logger.
			Download the maps, airspaces and airfields you need to your PC and
			install them from there in your PDA. See <A HREF="cumulus-maps.html">Maps</A>
			for more information. Airfields and map files can be downloaded
			automatically by Cumulus, if you enable this option at start-up.
		</DD>

		<DT>
			<B>Waypoints</B>
		</DT>

		<DD>
			Cumulus uses waypoints to facilitate navigation. You can either edit
			the waypoint files on the PDA or prepare them on a PC using <I>KFLog</I>
			and then transfer them to the PDA. See <A
				HREF="cumulus-waypoints.html">waypoints</A> for more details.
		</DD>

		<DT>
			<B>Tasks</B>
		</DT>

		<DD>
			Cumulus also supports the definition of flight tasks. You can either
			create and edit a task file on the PDA or prepare it first on your PC
			using <I>KFLog</I> before transferring it to the PDA. See <A
				HREF="cumulus-preflight-settings-task.html">here</A> for more
			details on tasks.
