	<h3 align="center">Tasks/Routes</h3>

	<p>
		Tasks are routes between waypoints which are handled as turnpoints here.
		They can be created and modified in the <a
		href="cumulus-preflight-settings-task.html"> Preflight
	  Settings-Task</a> menu. The task/route is drawn on the map using a dark magenta
		line with clearly marked turnpoint figures. The turnpoint figures can
		be configured under <a href="cumulus-settings-task.html"> Settings-Task</a>.
		Currently three taskpoint figures, line, circle and sector with  
    symmetrical angels are supported.
	</p>

	<p>
	  A task comprises at least two points according to FAI IGC, a Start and a
	  Finish point. Takeoff and Landing airfield are not more a mandatory part
	  of an IGC task. Therefore these points are not considered by Cumulus.
	  
	  Two Points are the minimum in Cumulus, if you will fly a direct route.
	  The used points have the following names in the display:
		
	<p><table border="1">
	
	  <tr>
	    <th>Taskpoint</th>
	    <th>Short Form</th>
	    <th>Description</th>
	  </tr>
	
	  <tr>
	  <td>Start</td>
	  <td>S</td>
	  <td>Here starts the task or route</td>
	  </tr>
	  
	  <tr>
	  <td>Turn</td>
	  <td>T</td>
	  <td>One or more turnpoints, can be omitted for a direct route</td>
	  </tr>
	
	  <tr>
	  <td>Finish</td>
	  <td>F</td>
	  <td>Here ends the task or route</td>
	  </tr>
		
	</table></p>
 
	<p>
		Cumulus stores every task in a single file. These files are to find under your
		selected <a href="cumulus-settings-personal.html#DataDirectory"> Data
		Directory</a> in a subdirectory with the name <i>tasks</i>. As file name
		uses Cumulus the task name extended by the suffix <i>.tsk</i>.
		You can make task file transfer between your PC and PDA but make it only
		when Cumulus is not running. Otherwise the results are undefined.
