Building and installing Cumulus for X11 and Qt4.x

These are the instructions to build and install Cumulus from source under Linux.

Step 1)

You will need to set up a building-environment for Qt4.x under X11 with Qt3
support if it is not already available. Download a X11/Qt release from
ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source. I recommend at the moment the release:

ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/qt-x11-opensource-src-4.3.3.tar.gz

I did the portage with this release. To install it follow the instructions of
Trolltech. For cumulus you need the Qt3 support. Do not forget to activate it
during run of configure script. If you want to debug Qt it is recommend to
activate the debug option during configure script run.

If you want to use your own built Qt version, you should add the
<QT_INSTALLDIR>/bin component at the first position of your PATH variable.

e.g. BASH example

	export $PATH=<QT_INSTALLDIR>/bin:$PATH

Step 3)
 
Checkout a cumulus snapshot file tree in a local directory of your Linux desktop with:

	a) svn co https://svn.heiner-lamprecht.de/svn/repos/cumulus/qt4/trunk
	b) svn export https://svn.heiner-lamprecht.de/svn/repos/cumulus/qt4/trunk

Variant b) is free from any svn overhead like .svn directories.

Step 4)

Go into the trunk directory of your checkout copy. To build the cumulus application issue the following command:

	make -f Makefile.x11

Step 5)

To install cumulus issue the following command:

	make -f Makefile.x11 install

The default installation directory of the application is /opt/cumulus. You need root access to do the installation there. If you would prefer another installation place, you can change the installation directory during call of make install in the following way:

	make -f Makefile.x11 INSTALL_ROOT=<my-install-path> install

Step 6)

The needed map data (airfields, airspaces and landscape) have to be installed under:

$HOME/maps or $INSTALL_ROOT/maps

The structure has modified a little bit and look like

        +-airfields
.../maps+-airspaces
        +-landscape

Note, that cumulus does up to now only support airspace files in open air format. The former support of KFLog airspace files has been removed.

For airfield files the welt 2000 data base should be used. The KFLog files are out of date. See cumulus help for more information.

The landscape files can be downloaded from the KFLog Map room. Follow the link below to get them.

http://www.kflog.org/maproom/ground-and-terrain-data

Step 7)

To start cumulus issue the command:

	$INSTALL_PATH/bin/cumulus


Personal stuff is stored under $HOME/cumulus. There you can find here the task file 'tasks.tsk' and the waypoint file 'cumulus.kwp'

The cumulus configuration file is to find under $HOME/.config/Cumulus.conf.

Under INSTALL_ROOT/bin you can find a NMEA simulator with name 'nmeaSimu'. You can use it for generation of NMEA data. Call it without any arguments and you will get a help usage displayed. The output of the simulator is written in a named pipe. Select in Cumulus as GPS device /tmp/nmeasim and cumulus will read the data from the simulator.

Have fun with cumulus ...
