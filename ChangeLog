-------------------------------------------------
Cumulus 2.0.x (Development based on X11/Qt-4.4.0)
-------------------------------------------------

[+] 2008-07-25 AP: Under Maemo the internal GPS daemon is now used to get the GPS data
                   from the BT or the internal GPS receiver. Cumulus does not more fork
                   an own GPS client process under Maemo.
[o] 2008-07-17 AP: Startup of the GPS client process moved to the end of
                   the cumulus initialization to get visible Maemo GPS connection
                   dialog.
[-] 2008-07-08 HH: Bugfix Openair parser: Two small bugfixes in arced airspaces
                   makeAngleArc() was using degrees instead of radians
                   addArc() was sometimes producing corrupt point arrays
                   because of a rounding error in the calculation of #steps.
[-] 2008-07-03 HH: Bugfix Openair parser: Comments at the end of lines caused problems.
                   Decimal notation of coordinates wasn't handled
                   correctly if there was a different number of
                   digits than two. Tks to Hendrik.
[o] 2008-07-03 AP: Map drawing optimized. Some more static things moved from
                   info layer to navi layer. C Function sscanf did not work
                   correct in GPSNMEA parser. Substituted by QString methods.
[-] 2008-06-28 AP: Bugfix: Rounding problem fixed in airspace class.
                   New formatted string for flight level altitude.
[+] 2008-06-28 AP: Openairparser added support for the limit types AGL (= GND)
                   and STD (= FL*100).
[-] 2008-05-18 AP: Bugfix: Rounding problem in degree convertion from internal kflog
                   format to display format e.g. in waypoint editor fixed.
[-] 2008-05-09 AP: Bugfix: missing comma in polar data record of Junior added
[+] 2008-05-08 AP: Textsize in map display boxes automatically adapted to the available space
                   of the box. Thanks to Josua Dietze for his contribution ;-)
[-] 2008-05-05 AP: Bugfix: A new user data directory was not saved in configuration file.
[-] 2008-05-05 AP: Bugfix: Wind arrow for 360 degrees was not displayed due to missing
                   icon for that direction.
[-] 2008-04-30 AP: Bugfix: Mouse snapping for info display fixed. On high zoom
                   level wrong data were snapped.
[-] 2008-04-23 AP: Airspace filling reworked
[-] 2008-04-20 AP: Performance improvements for airspace and isoline drawings provided
                   by Josua Dietze. Thanks to him for his contributions.
[+] 2008-04-18 AP: Warning display in window title bar removed. Maemo has in full
                   screen mode no title bar. Instead of in status bar selected glider
                   and last displayed warning message added.
[-] 2008-04-17 AP: Support for old KFLog binary airfield files removed. Use welt2000
                   as replacement. 
[-] 2008-04-13 AP: Bugfix: Qt4 portage has failed in using qSort method. It works
                   only for value and not for pointer elements. I fixed it.
                   Concerned classes were wind measurement, rechable points, isolines
                   and airspaces.
[+] 2008-04-11 AP: Waypoint display format adapted to N800 size
[-] 2008-04-10 AP: Bugfix: reread of all map files, if user has made a new
                   map root directory selection.

                   Class TaskDialog renamed to TaskEditor to get more clearness.
[-] 2008-04-02 AP: Bugfix: Problem fixed in task dialog, when waypoint list is empty.
                   In such a case the items in the airfield list were not accessable.
[+] 2008-04-02 AP: Zoom keys F7/F8 added in help browser for Maemo and X11.
[-] 2008-03-29 AP: Bugfix: Last position was never saved as new center position on restart
                   of cumulus. Fixed now.
[+] 2008-03-21 AP: New map design introduced. All display boxes are moved from the top to
                   the left side. Thanks to Josua Dietze for his contribution.
[+] 2008-03-13 AP: File selection box added in configuration dialog of information settings
                   for sound player selection by the user. QSound does not work sure,
                   now the user can choice its own sound player.
[+] 2008-03-08 AP: Directory selection box added in configuration dialog of map settings
                   for map directory definition by the user

                   list, if the distance was nearly zero between current position
		   and target.
[-] 2008-02-29 AP: Bugfix: Memory problem in glider list and editor fixed.
                   It caused a crash if the config dialog was closed and a new
		   glider was added.

, which toggles menu by mouse press
[-] 2008-02-13 AP: Bugfix: partly wrong usage of QMessageBox. The result was
                   checked against a hard coded interger value instead using
                   the QMessageBox enumration types. The enums are modified
                   to Qt4, therefore the hard coded compare did not work.

Cumulus 1.0 (31-10-2002)
------------------------
[o] derived from 0.5 beta


Cumulus 0.5 beta (not released)
-------------------------------
[-] Bug in the calculation of flightlevels.
[+] Added some details in the PDA-documentation (cumulus.html)
[o] More optimized functioncalls (thanks Eggert!)
[-] Unnesecairy double serial connection instantiation.
[-] Unnesecairy double mapmatrix creation when changing zoomfactor.
[+] Confirmationdialog before stopping logging.
[+] Line from current position to waypoint as visual indication of direction of waypoint.
[o] The algorithm that determined if an isoline was drawn at a certain zoomlevel caused
    problems with the lower levels: sometimes no land was drawn at all. The algorithm has
    been modified to solve this problem. Also, a finer devision has been made, causing
    less lines to be drawn in the higher mapscales but at better intervals.
[+] Basic task support. The selected task is drawn on the map with photosectors. There are still
    some problems with line not being drawn or being drawn in the wrong place. Working on that!
[-] Bug wich caused Cumulus to crash if you tried to center on a waypoint while none was
    selected.(thanks Eggert!)
[o] Improved the drawing of the symbols on the map. Its a bit faster now. (thanks Eggert!)
[+] Added a mapconfiguration tab in the settings dialog. You can turn the bearing-lines and the
    isolines on and off.

-----------------------------
[+] Changelog!
[+] You can now also delete waypoints.
[o] Elevations and runwaylengths in the waypointeditor are now
    displayed and entered in the correct units (which is displayed).

[-] Size :-) The app has become smaller.
[-] Fixed problem with maploading.
[-] Removed ugly workaround (thanks Eggert!)
[o] Several functioncalls optimized (thanks Eggert!)
[+] Caching mapredraws, resulting in fewer redraws thus better performance.
    It also results in a small if a redraw is needed, because Cumulus waits
    for a small time to see if there are other changes that may result in a
    mapredraw.
[o] Current position is now displayed in centerarea of the map, not only
    in the center itself. Result is less redraws.
[+] Statusmessage if the zoom on waypoint can't be executed
[-] Bug in startup, resulting in an invalid maptile-reference
    This did not result in a problem on the desktop, but chrashed the Z

    connection was temporary lost and the map had been moved manually in
    the meantime.
[o] Maximum scale raised from 800 to 1000 meters/pixel (so,
    about 200x200 km map). We must check if that is still workable or not.
