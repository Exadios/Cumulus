[+] 2009-08-31 AP: Flight status background color is set to green, if logger
                   is running. If logger is in standby flight status background
                   color is set to yellow. Old solution with setting of letter L
                   to bold was not ported to Qt4.5. Hope that new solution is
                   better visible as before.
[+] 2009-08-13 AP: New unit option time added to settings menu. You can now choose
                   between Utc or local time for the display.
[-] 2009-08-13 AP: BUGFIX: Wrong UTC time display in sunset fixed. Hours greater
                   than 23 were displayed. Saw it during by Boston/USA trip.

-------------------------------------------------
[o] 2009-07-16 AP: Switch to new ground and terrain file format to use the
                   new maps provided by Hendrik Hoeth. Thanks to him for
                   his contribution.
[-] 2009-07-14 AP: Option 'remove original map files after compilation' in
                   Map Settings removed. There is enough space on the Internet
                   tablets.
[o] 2009-07-06 AP: Build done with new release Qt4.5.2

-------------------------------------------------

[o] 2009-05-28 AP: Last selected flight task stored permanently now.
[o] 2009-05-25 AP: Layout of TaskEditor modified to get an uniform look.
[-] 2009-05-24 AP: BUGFIX: Arrival altitude was not displayed in extra label info.
[-] 2009-05-22 AP: BUGFIX: GPS user altitude correction factor has to be added
                   to and not subtracted to the received altitude. Otherwise the
                   direction of the correction factor works inverse.
[o] 2009-05-19 AP: Layout of WaypointListView modified. Editor command buttons
                   were moved from the top to the right side of the widget
                   to get more space for the waypoint list display. Thanks
                   to Robin King for the proposal ;-)
[-] 2009-05-18 AP: BUGFIX: Waypoint coordinate format DMM did not worked.

[o] 2009-05-06 AP: All runway directions are handled now according to the Welt2000
                   definitions. That is a little bit tricky but consistent. Waypoint editor
                   adapted to that new handling. Two runway directions can be defined via
                   combo boxes. A valid runway directions comprises the range 01...36.
                   The value 0 is used for unknown. Storage in waypoint file modified, old
                   formats will be converted automatically to the new one.
[o] 2009-05-04 AP: Outlanding fields added to task editor.
[o] 2009-04-29 AP: Home button to AirfieldListView added.
[o] 2009-04-29 AP: Zoom buttons on the map enlarged by 10 pixels more under

[+] 2009-04-29 AP: Outlandings read from Welt2000 file and displayed at the map and
                   in the lists. New configuration option added to Welt2000 tabulator
                   to activate or deactivate the loading of outlandings. Labels
                   of outlandings can be switched on/off too now. Outlandings
                   are included in the reachable list.
                   
-------------------------------------------------
Cumulus 2.2.x (Development based on X11/Qt-4.5.0)
-------------------------------------------------

                   start default browser of OS.
[o] 2009-04-22 AP: Widget PreFlightGliderPage pilots name and units in spin boxes
                   added.
[+] 2009-04-22 AP: Plus and minus zoom buttons added to the map at the right side.
                   Now zooming is easier possible and also via finger touch.
[o] 2009-04-22 AP: Title added to airspace color chooser dialog.
[-] 2009-04-21 AP: BUGFIX: Conversion of coordinates from internal format to
                   DMS format leads sometimes to invalid results.
[-] 2009-04-17 HM: Cleaned up all the gcc v4.3.2 warnings.
[+] 2009-04-08 AP: User default data directory under Maemo changed from $HOME/cumulus
                   to $HOME/MyDocs/Cumulus to be Maemo conform. This location is also
                   shown by the tablet file manager.
[+] 2009-04-08 AP: Airfield labels are drawn now on request. New menu and
                   configuration options are added for that.
[o] 2009-04-08 AP: In HwInfo class hardware filter modified for better recognizing
                   of internet tablets N800/N810.
[+] 2009-04-07 AP: Check added after done map directory selection, if expected
                   map subdirectories are exist. If not, the user is ask for
                   their creation.
[-] 2009-04-07 AP: BUGFIX: A earlier done map directory selection was never
                   reloaded again in the directory selection dialog. Load starts
                   always with home directory.
[o] 2009-04-06 AP: English online help partly updated.
[o] 2009-04-06 AP: Default home radius of Welt2000 airfield focus narrowed from
                   1000Km to 500Km to save memory.
[o] 2009-04-06 AP: Start auto logging option stored permanently.
[+] 2009-04-02 AP: The waypoint priority (low, normal, high) and the related
                   draw scale limit can be defined now in settings map objects.
                   So the user can adapt the limits more to this needs.
[o] 2009-04-01 AP: New method __drawLabel introduced in class Map. The code was
                   extracted from the __drawWaypoints method. Will be used for
                   common label drawing up to now.
[o] 2009-04-01 AP: A flight task was drawn after the waypoint labels.
                   That has hidden underlying labels. Draw order changed.
[-] 2009-03-31 AP: BUGFIX: A selected waypoint was never removed from the map
                   display, if it was removed from the waypoint list.
[+] 2009-03-31 AP: Look&Feel tabulator extended by a speed spin box. If selected
                   speed is fallen below the screen saver is switched on.
[o] 2009-03-26 AP: Waypoint labels and extra information text boxes redesigned.
                   All is drawn directly at the pixmap again. That ensures,
                   that the glider or cross symbol are not hidden by the text boxes
                   as before.
[-] 2009-03-26 AP: BUGFIX: A added airfield or glider site to the waypoint list,
                   was only displayed after a cumulus restart. Projected coordinates
                   were forgotten to copy.
[o] 2009-03-24 AP: GPS setting tabulator modified for Maemo, that a speed can be
                   selected too, if the USB device was chosen. The USB-RS232
                   driver can need that to get initialized with the right baud rate.
[o] 2009-03-24 AP: GpsClient process modified, that the connection to the GPS
                   receiver is closed and reopened again after a read timeout.
                   That shall help to release temporary mounted devices like
                   USB or Bluetooth after a connection break. 
[-] 2009-03-23 AP: Wrong string part removed in task switch widget display.
[-] 2009-03-18 AP: Bugfix: Bug in QFileDialog for directory selection has been
                   corrected by Qt Software in release 4.5.0. Workaround in
                   cumulus removed.
[-] 2009-03-18 AP: Bugfix: Broken BT-GPS connection, caused by switch off of GPS
                   mouse, should be reconnected now after switch on.
[-] 2009-03-18 AP: Bugfix: Core dump fixed caused some times by recursive calling
                   of GpsMaemo::readGpsData(). The internal buffer pointers were
                   destroyed by the second call. Protection added to avoid that.
[-] 2009-03-13 AP: Cambridge wind direction angle inverted.
[+] 2009-03-11 AP: Cumulus build with official released Qt-4.5.0.
 
-------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------
[-] 2009-03-11 AP: Bugfix: Popup dialogs during startup phase on Maemo were placed
                   under the wait screen dialog. Removed stay on top flag in
                   WaitScreen class. That was not a problem under Gentoo/X11.
[-] 2009-03-11 AP: Bugfix: Green and magenta circle pixmaps did not work on Maemo
                   if transparency is used. Don't find out why, maybe a bug?
[o] 2009-03-10 AP: Some classes and data types renamed to get more clarity about them.
[-] 2009-03-10 AP: Bugfix: Switch between manual mode and GPS mode was to early.
                   Now it is done, when the GPS has recognized a valid fix and
                   not already after a successful established connection.
[o] 2009-03-10 AP: Village and outlanding icons redesigned. The outlanding icon 
                   is placed so at the map, that the base of the beacon points
                   to the map point.
[o] 2009-03-05 AP: Waypoint and thermal icons redesigned and placed so at the map,
                   that the lower stick end of the flag points to the map point.
                   The old position was in the center of the icon and caused
                   misinterpretations about the right position.
[+] 2009-03-04 AP: Splash picture added during startup of cumulus.
[o] 2009-03-04 AP: Green and magenta circle pixmaps replaced by two new methods in class

[o] 2009-03-02 AP: English online help partly reworked.
[-] 2009-03-27 AP: Bugfix: Wrong decoding of pressure altitudes of Cambridge
                   device fixed.
[+] 2009-02-25 AP: GPS parser/decoder extended to read additional proprietary records
                   from a Cambridge logger device. Wind, variometer, QNH, pressure
                   altitude are processed now.
[+] 2009-02-25 AP: USB device added in GPS settings tabulator. Data can be read in now
                   via a RS232-USB adapter into the N800/N810.
                   Furthermore Altitude selection box is extended by a Pressure field.
                   If Pressure is selected, only pressure GPS altitude records will be
                   used and processed.
[o] 2009-02-24 AP: Map side bar color can be modified via color chooser dialog
                   in Look&Feel setting tabulator now.
[o] 2009-02-24 AP: Terrain colors list reduced from 200 elements to 50. Mapping of
                   elevation value to isoline array index done by a hash table now
                   during read in. That reduces the processing time a little bit more.
[+] 2009-02-18 AP: New setting tabulator Terrain Colors added, where the colors
                   of the different elevations can be defined resp. redefined.
                   Subterrain color (no map ground data loaded) and ground color
                   (isoline drawing is disabled) can also be configured now.
[o] 2009-02-17 AP: Look&Feel setting tabulator modified. Font size box replaced by
                   font dialog. That opens more possibilities for the personal
                   configuration.
[+] 2009-02-04 AP: Airspace fill colors can be defined resp. modified by user
                   in airspace settings configuration tabulator.

[-] 2008-11-13 JD: Bugfix: WP edit dialog sometimes forgot lat/lon values.
[o] 2008-11-13 JD: WP list filter handling changed; sorting now done in QList instead
                   of list widget. Speed gain (large AF list), stable WP list editing
[o] 2008-10-28 AP: All drawing check options removed in class MapContent. All other
                   classes calling directly now GeneralConfig.
                   Pinter pen, brush and iso color lists changed to value based lists.
[-] 2008-10-28 AP: Bugfix: Additional checks added in calculator for proofing of
                   manual move. Now it is not more possible to leave the earth
                   coordinate system over 90 or 180 degrees.
[o] 2008-10-23 AP: Additional checks added in waypoint editor. Mandatory items
                   name and description have to be entered before accept. Already
                   existing names in the global list can not be reused now.
                   The user is informed via message box about every found problem.
[-] 2008-10-21 AP: Bugfix: Radius for mouse snapping was set to 3km and scaled
                   with zoom level. On low zoom level this was to large. Radius
                   modified to a fixed value and not more scaled.
[o] 2008-10-16 AP: Class Airport renamed to Airfield, FlightPoint class 
                   outsourced from wayPoint and put in a separate file.

    setting waterbalast and selecting a task.
[+] Map file are now stored in a projected format with first loading. The
    original file is optionally deleted. This makes for a huge speedincrease
    in loading maps! Thanks to Jushua Dietze!
[+] The compiled files are much smaller than the original files.
[+] Waypoint labels can now be turned off and on, both in the Settings
    and in during flight. Use the A key or the menu for that.
[-] Axel Pauli removed a memory leak and other problems from the GPS connection
    code. No more lost sentences! Also optimized and trimmed down to the essentials.
    Thanks Axel!
[+] Information in popups is shown longer if there are more items in the list. Made
    configurable by Axel.
[o] The H button now is used instead of the Home button in manual navigation.
[o] Layout of main screen changed for better readability.
[+] You can now select waypoints directly from the map.
[+] You can now choose different projections to use, and modify the parameters used
    for the projection from the Advanced map configuration page.
[+] Sound warnings can be turned on and off.
[o] Many bugs in flightmode detection and windcalculation fixed.
[-] Bug in the calculation of flightlevels.

And many other things we don't quite remember now...


Cumulus 1.0 (31-10-2002)
------------------------
[o] derived from 0.5 beta


Cumulus 0.5 beta (not released)
-------------------------------
[-] Bug in the calculation of flightlevels.
[+] Added some details in the PDA-documentation (cumulus.html)
[o] More optimized functioncalls (thanks Eggert!)
[-] Unnesecairy double serial connection instantiation.
[-] Unnesecairy double mapmatrix creation when changing zoomfactor.
[+] Confirmationdialog before stopping logging.
[+] Line from current position to waypoint as visual indication of direction of waypoint.
[o] The algorithm that determined if an isoline was drawn at a certain zoomlevel caused
    problems with the lower levels: sometimes no land was drawn at all. The algorithm has
    been modified to solve this problem. Also, a finer devision has been made, causing
    less lines to be drawn in the higher mapscales but at better intervals.
[+] Basic task support. The selected task is drawn on the map with photosectors. There are still
    some problems with line not being drawn or being drawn in the wrong place. Working on that!
[-] Bug wich caused Cumulus to crash if you tried to center on a waypoint while none was
    selected.(thanks Eggert!)
[o] Improved the drawing of the symbols on the map. Its a bit faster now. (thanks Eggert!)
[+] Added a mapconfiguration tab in the settings dialog. You can turn the bearing-lines and the
    isolines on and off.
[o] Changed the source directory structure.
[+] Added an about box, available with SHIFT+V. (thanks Eggert!)
[+] Cumulus now disables the automatic power-off of the Zaurus while it's running. (thanks Eggert!)
[-] Unnecessary destruction and recreation of serial connection when changing other settings.
[o] Modified the connection-speed list in GPS setting tab to include more speeds and not to
    allow other values than the pre-defined ones, since they were not recognized anyway.
    Serial connection speeds of 600 up to 57400 baud are now supported.
[o] Authors emailaddress changed to andre@kflog.org.
[o] Changed changed-symbol in this log from [*] to [o] to make it stand out better against
    the [+] added symbol.
[o] Optimalisations in the serial communication unit and MNEA analyser (Eggert).
[+] The statusbar now displays the number of satelites in view (Eggert).
[+] The mouse/stylus can be used to show airfield and airspace info (Eggert).
[+] The serial port is resetted and reactivated in case of cf card interface after resume (Eggert)
[o] New helpfile structure.
[+] Screen to indicate what's happening during long operations.
[o] Some changes in the maploading. Maps load way faster now.
[+] Info is send to the GPS after a resume, to decrease GPS aquisition time.
[+] Basic glider polar calculation, glide path information and graphical polar display.
[+] Added options not to load isolines, roads, highways, railroads, cities and waterways.
[-] Bug with the taskselection where not selecting a task and pressing OK would result in a crash.
[+] Waypoints can be added from the detailed airfield information display now.


Cumulus 0.4 beta (13/09/2002)
-----------------------------
[+] Changelog!
[+] You can now also delete waypoints.
[o] Elevations and runwaylengths in the waypointeditor are now
    displayed and entered in the correct units (which is displayed).
[o] Application now starts with homesite as mapcenter.
[-] Size :-) The app has become smaller.
[-] Fixed problem with maploading.
[-] Removed ugly workaround (thanks Eggert!)
[o] Several functioncalls optimized (thanks Eggert!)
[+] Caching mapredraws, resulting in fewer redraws thus better performance.
    It also results in a small if a redraw is needed, because Cumulus waits
    for a small time to see if there are other changes that may result in a
    mapredraw.
[o] Current position is now displayed in centerarea of the map, not only
    in the center itself. Result is less redraws.
[+] Statusmessage if the zoom on waypoint can't be executed
[-] Bug in startup, resulting in an invalid maptile-reference
    This did not result in a problem on the desktop, but chrashed the Z
[-] Bug where the map would not return to the GPS position, if the GPS
    connection was temporary lost and the map had been moved manually in
    the meantime.
[o] Maximum scale raised from 800 to 1000 meters/pixel (so,
    about 200x200 km map). We must check if that is still workable or not.
[+] You can now edit a waypoint's comment field.


Cumulus 0.3 beta (08/09/2002)
-----------------------------
[+] Manual navigation mode
[+] Waypoint editor
[+] Waypoint labels are drawn on the 'inside' of the map
[+] Scale indicator on the map, in the correct units
[-] Couple of bugs


Cumulus 0.2 beta
----------------
Sorry, don't know anymore.


Cumulus 0.1 beta
----------------
[+] First public release.
