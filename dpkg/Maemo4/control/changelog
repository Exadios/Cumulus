cumulus (2.13.3) stable; urgency=low

  * BUGFIX: Flight trail option was not changeable in setup page map objects.

  * QFontDialog replaced by an own programmed font dialog because the
    QFontDialog widget is to large on Android. Found no way to make QFontDialog
    smaller.

  * New option introduced in setup airspace, which allows to skip airspaces
    laying over a predefined vertical border. I found an airspace file with a
    lot of information in the upper airspace, which are not more of interest
    for glider pilots. With the help of this option you can filter out upper
    airspaces now.
                   
  * Option force drawing ... in setup airspace removed. It caused sometimes a
    lot of unwanted warnings.

cumulus (2.13.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Classical menubar replaced by a context popup menu. That prevents that the
    space of the map display is reduced when the menu is opened.

  * Flight trail drawing introduced. The last 5 minutes are drawn as trail on
    the map. Trail drawing can be switched on/off via the context menu.

  * Logger backtrack storage changed from 30 to 60 entries. The backtrack storage
    saves the logger records before a take off is recognized in auto mode to have
    a good ground line.

  * Under Android a Qt window splitter is not operable with fingers. Therefore
    I changed the window layout of the preflight task page. Now only the listed
    tasks are to see, if you enter the page. If a task is selected and you press
    the show button, the task content is displayed on the task page instead of
    the task list. I think that is a better solution as before. For both widgets
    is now more space available.

  * Font handling optimized for different hardware devices.

  * Landmark pixmap enlarged from 8x8 pixels to 10x10 pixels to make it better
    visible at the map.

  * BUGFIX: If the glider load or water ballast was modified, the wing load was
    never updated on the preflight glider page.

cumulus (2.12.3) stable; urgency=low

  * BUGFIX: Due to a programming error the wind calculation did not work as
    expected. I notice that on my first cross country flight in this year.
    This bug is fixed now.

cumulus (2.12.2) stable; urgency=low

  * Build is done now with Qt4.8.1.

  * To overcome the hidden restrictions of a QMessageBox an own solution was
    programmed for the disclaimer display at program start.

  * GUI surface partly reworked. OK and Cancel button of some widgets moved to
    a new position where an unwanted press should not happen during normal
    operation.

  * Fonts can use point size or pixel size. Both in parallel is not possible.
    Tried to make more generic the setting of an own font size according to the
    used default (points or pixels).

  * Operation of Flarm alias list modified. A double click on a table column was
    not so easy to execute. Now if a cell is clicked an extra dialog is opened
    to handle the input for that cell. Rows can be selected by clicking the left
    row number button.

  * Zoom issue fixed in help browser.

  * The waypoint default type is set to landmark now, if the waypoint editor is
    opened for waypoint creation.

  * Missing time zone item UTC added to sunset in the arrival display.

  * Method determineFlightStatus of Calculator class modified. The flight status
    detection should now work safer and faster as before.

  * New option skip added to NMEA simulator. This option allows to skip a number
    of lines in a file to be played.

cumulus (2.12.1) stable; urgency=low

  * All Qt default spinboxes are replaced by an own improved solutions.
    That should make the operation more user friendly now.

  * Co-pilot name and current water ballast are saved now, if the
    pre-flight dialog is left with the OK button.

cumulus (2.12.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Build is done now with Qt4.8.0.
  
  * Flight mode wave removed. It is not clearly to decide, when a glider is
    flying in the wave.
  
  * If the IGC logger operates in auto start mode the current flight time is
    displayed now in the flight parameters dialog. This dialog is opened by
    pressing the Mc display box.
  
  * If the IGC logger operates in auto start mode and the flight mode changes
    to unknown or still stand, the logfile is automatically closed after 90s now.
  
  * Wrong entry in file glider.pol fixed.
   
  * Reachable list overworked. Two buttons added for page scrolling. If an entry
    is selected and the list is scrolled no jump more to the selected position
    after a list update. That makes the viewing of the list easier for the user.
   
  * If the flight state is cruising and a target is selected,
    a relative bearing information is displayed at the top of the
    map, if this option is activated in the map object menu.
    The relative bearing information shows the necessary direction
    and the degrees of correction to be made to fly directly to
    the target.
    
  * Wing load value added to pre-flight glider page and to glider polar drawing.
   
  * The navigate to home button function did not set the
    home elevation. That caused a wrong arrival altitude display.
    The problem was difficult to recognize, if the home site
    elevation is low. But in Gariep Dam in South Africa I
    detected the issue because it lays ca. 1300m above MSL.

  * If a target is selected, the drawing of a track line can be
    activated now in the task setup configuration menu. The track
    line shows the current movement direction. So you can easier
    see, if you are on the bearing line to your selected target
    or not.

  * New cross button added to waypoint list view. Pressing the
    button will remove all waypoint entries of the list after
    confirmation. That make it easier and faster to clear the
    whole list as using the select all and remove feature.
    
  * On the Linux desktop the mouse wheel can be used now for zoom actions.
    
  * Map type highway renamed to motorway according to OSM usage.
    
  * Waypoint import routine for cup files enhanced, that also
    runway length values can be handled using unit feet. That is
    not conform to the SeeYou specification but I saw that in
    a south African waypoint file.
    
  * The type of an user added waypoint by pressing the bearing
    icon was changed from turnpoint to landmark. The middle
    position of a square is better to see at the map as a lot of
    flags.
    
  * The first airspace of an airspace file was never loaded. It is fixed now.
    
  * SeeYou waypoint import filter modified.
    
  * Disclaimer tabulator added to AboutWidget.
    
  * Added a new button to the FLARM radar view to make it easier
    to add alias names for hexadecimal Flarm Identifiers. A
    selected Flarm object can be assigned an alias name now by
    using the plus button.
    
  * City labels are drawn at the map now, if the scale is less
    than 100. But some of the city labels are wrong. That seems
    to be a problem in the KFLog data base.

cumulus (2.11.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Build is done now with Qt4.7.4
  
  * New waypoint import filter added for import of WinPilot and CAI waypoint
    files with extension .dat.
    
  * New configuration option Save NMEA Data added to GPS settings page. The
    received NMEA data can be stored in a file now for later analysis.
  
  * Map can be moved now by pressing left mouse button and mouse move to a new
    position in manual mode. That works a little bit slow but it works ;-)
