cumulus (5.14.0) stable; urgency=low

  * BUGFIX: The wind triangle calculation did not work on task
    display, if wind speed or direction were modified.
    
  * Airfield frequency added to reachable list overview.
    
  * Tried to improve provided wind information more related to
    the current altitude.
    
  * Short names of openAIP airfield data are unique now per country.
    
  * If the elevation offset of the terrain color is moved down
    under zero, the last assigned color is green and not more blue
    because blue is the color of the sea and not of land.

  * Changes in the flight glider dialog done for Mc, bug or water
    values are reported immediately to the calculator and the map
    to see their effects to the current glide path. If the dialog
    is left via cancel all changes are reverted.

  * Bugfix: The generated PDF documentation was incomplete for
    a longer time. Newer help pages were not included. I
    changed the pdf generation script from a fixed file list
    to a dynamic generated one.

  * New pre-flight page added for manual wind configuration. If
    you tip longer on the wind label at the map view, the wind
    configuration page is opened too. Futhermore this page
    displays a wind statistics over the last flight hour.

  * Bugfix: If the unit was changed in the altimeter dialog,
    the gained altitude display was not immediately updated.

  * Bugfix: Issues fixed in settings airfields page. The entered
    airfields were not saved in every case.

  * Bugfix: Altitude leveling value has going lost, if the altitude
    unit was changed during leveling. Furthermore the correction value was never
    saved for the unit feet.

  * Download of openAIP airfield and airspace data on first startup after
    installation, if a country could be regognized.

  * New setting page added for openAIP airspaces download under settings
    airspaces. Now the user can install openAIP airspaces in Cumulus via
    this new download feature.

  * Welt2000 update check string adapted to last Welt2000 release.

  * QNH calculation improved by using an official formula and not more a fixed
    value in AltimeterDialog widget.
    
  * If the load or water value is changed in the pre-flight glider menu
    successfully, the new value is stored in the glider list and saved,
    if the user leave the menu via the OK button. If the user moves through
    the gilder list, done load or water changes for a single list entry will not
    more discared, if the selection is changed.
    
  * New feature added that can parse, store and load openAIP airspace files.
    The airspaces are defined by using XML syntax. See http://www.openaip.net
    for more info.

cumulus (5.5.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Remove file function and directory name display added to openair and
    airfield display table.
                   
  * On pre-fight airfield new feature openAIP added whichs allows the use of
    openAIP airfield files provided by www.openaip.net. Create an account at
    that webpage to get the access to such airfield files.

  * On pre-fight a new page added with name Retriever. This feature is only
    available under Android. After an outlanding the pilot can send a SMS to his
    retriever crew containing the outlanding position coordinates.

  * Airfield name handling in openAIP importer modified. Upper lower case
    airfield names introduced.

cumulus (5.3.1) stable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: Overflow fixed in openair parser. The upper airspace border was
    wrong in a compiled file version, if the altitude was greater than 10000m.

  * Background and text color of waypoint, taskpoint info display and flight
    dialogs can be toggled between white/black and vise versa in settings
    information now. Black background and white text is mostly better to read
    in sunshine.

cumulus (5.2.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Reset button added to altitude and in-flight dialog. That
    resets the input field which has the focus to its initial
    value.
    
  * New subdirectory igc introduced for storing of IGC files.
    
  * Bugfix: Flight taskpoint switch did not work at slow speed.
    If end and landing point of a flight task were the same points
    the task end was not recognized.
    
  * Behaviour of altitude, inflight and variometer dialog
    modified. If a value is changed, the close timer is stopped,
    so that the user must confirm or reject his done change.
    
  * Bugfix: Auto logger start speed was never read from
    the configuration due to a spelling error. Thanks to
    Robin King who reported the bug to me.
    
  * Bugfix: The task parser stumbled if a taskpoint contains a
    comment text with a newline. Comment field removed from the
    saved tasks file.
    
  * NMEA simulator expanded that GPS data can also be sent out
    via a serial device like ttyS0.
    
  * Bugfix: The begin and the end of a task were not correct
    handled, if the taskpoint figure was a line.
    
  * Runway heading combo selection boxes replaced by a number
    editor input widget in waypoint editor. 

  * Bugfix: Negative numbers could not saved in number editor.

  * Bugfix: Needless elevation unit removed in waypoint editor.

  * Class TaskPoint is now derived from SinglePoint and not more
    from Waypoint. A taskpoint has only the basic data of a
    single point and its special data. That is clearer to handle.

  * Waypoint editor modified. Two runways can be edited now as
    single runways. The runway handling has been modified in
    airfield and waypoint data. The single runway data elements
    have been replaced by a runway list in these data objects.

  * A XML parser added to import Open AIP data files via the pre-flight waypoint
    page. Hotspot, navigation aid and airfield data can be imported now.

  * A Debian source package can be build now for the X11 desktop
    version of Cumulus.

  * Preflight Flarm page, stealth mode button added to show and to change that
    mode.

  * Bugfix: Sink speed in glider editor contained only one decimal. Changed it
    back to two.

  * Map info boxes can be switched on/off by moving left/right on the map with
    the mouse/fingers, if a GPS Fix is available. Otherwise the map is moved.

  * Glider Pegase added to gilder polar file.

  * Maximum scale to 1:60 reduced where city labels are drawn. Too much
    overlapping of labels in the region of Berlin. The former maximum scale
    was 1:100.

cumulus (5.0.1) stable; urgency=low

  * Task support enhanced by start and finish line. Single turnpoints of a task
    can be configured individually now.
    
  * Added a Qt version tag to the compiled data streams of Welt2000 and openair
    parser to avoid crashes, if you go back from Qt5 to Qt4.
    
  * Bugfix: ReachpointListView up down buttons did not work.
  
  * Auto zoom added, if the near of a turnpoint is reached. This feature can be
    switched on/off via a configuration option.
    
  * Settings menu modified from a tab menu to a list menu.
  
  * Preflight menu modified from a tab menu to a list menu.

  * New feature gain altitude added to altitude dialog. If the S button is
    pressed, the gained altitude is calculated and displayed in the dialog.
    That is a cool feature, if you have to make a certain altitude gain, e.g.
    for the Silver-C, Gold-C or a diamond.

  * Bugfix: Additional checks added in OpenAir parser to prevent that wrong
    defined coordinates are taken over. That caused sometimes a crash.

  * Free space check bug fixed in FlarmLogbook.

  * Timeout handling for Flarm download modified to avoid popup of error boxes.
  
  * Overflow issue fixed in HwInfo::getFreeUserSpace. Reported free disk space
    was wrong.
    
  * Do not reporting a landing, if IGC log file was not opened.
  
  * Home site name added to personal page.
  
  * If moving away from a violated airspace no longer alarms are generated, if
    movement is from inside, to very near, to near and out side.

  * If a task was set and the last taskpoint was selected, the arrival altitude
    display showed always zero.

  * Combo boxes for sky directions replaced against toggle buttons in coordinate
    editor. Makes the operation with fingers simpler as before.
    
  * Flarm IGC file download support added.

  * Don't remove an old NMEA logfile, if its size is zero. That shall prevent
    that an existing backup file with content is replaced by nothing.

  * Flarm alarms are shown as popups over the map now. This feature can be
    switched on/off via settings->information. It is not yet tested in all
    details.

  * Calculate the QNH automatically, if altitude level is adjusted by the user
    and a pressure based altitude is delivered.

cumulus (2.15.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Map label boxes made a little bit smaller. Takeoff and landing is signaled
    to the user as notification, if the logger works in auto mode.

  * New functionality flight logbook added. It contains the basic data of a
    flight (date, takeoff, landing, flight time, pilot). This feature works only,
    if auto logging is enabled!
    A new button logbook added on the pre-flight common page to open it. A user
    can remove all or selected entries from the logbook, if he wants. 

  * Proxy settings on different settings pages moved to personal
    page. Only on that page an Internet proxy can be defined now.

  * Altimeter settings dialog modified, that the altitude reference
    (GPS/Pressure) can also be changed in it.

  * The left map sidebar containing the info boxes can be toggled now in its
    visibility by using the shortcut key D.

cumulus (2.14.0) stable; urgency=low

  * New airspace status display added, that shows the user an overview, if
    airspaces are violated or if he is in the near of an airspace. Pressing at
    the map for one second opens a popup widget with the airspace information.
    Furthermore the display can be opened via the menu.

cumulus (2.13.3) stable; urgency=low

  * Glider editor widget modified due to problems on Android device Motorola Defy.

  * BUGFIX: Airspace Prohibited was never drawn at the map. A new checkbox was
    added in the setup airspace page to enable or disable drawing.

  * BUGFIX: Flight trail option was not changeable in setup page map objects.

  * QFontDialog replaced by an own programmed font dialog because the
    QFontDialog widget is to large on Android. Found no way to make QFontDialog
    smaller.

  * New option introduced in setup airspace, which allows to skip airspaces
    laying over a predefined vertical border. I found an airspace file with a
    lot of information in the upper airspace, which are not more of interest
    for glider pilots. With the help of this option you can filter out upper
    airspaces now.
                   
  * Option force drawing ... in setup airspace removed. It caused sometimes a
    lot of unwanted warnings.

cumulus (2.13.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Classical menubar replaced by a context popup menu. That prevents that the
    space of the map display is reduced when the menu is opened.

  * Flight trail drawing introduced. The last 5 minutes are drawn as trail on
    the map. Trail drawing can be switched on/off via the context menu.

  * Logger backtrack storage changed from 30 to 60 entries. The backtrack storage
    saves the logger records before a take off is recognized in auto mode to have
    a good ground line.

  * Under Android a Qt window splitter is not operable with fingers. Therefore
    I changed the window layout of the preflight task page. Now only the listed
    tasks are to see, if you enter the page. If a task is selected and you press
    the show button, the task content is displayed on the task page instead of
    the task list. I think that is a better solution as before. For both widgets
    is now more space available.

  * Font handling optimized for different hardware devices.

  * Landmark pixmap enlarged from 8x8 pixels to 10x10 pixels to make it better
    visible at the map.

  * BUGFIX: If the glider load or water ballast was modified, the wing load was
    never updated on the preflight glider page.

cumulus (2.12.2) stable; urgency=low

  * Build is done now with Qt4.8.1.

  * To overcome the hidden restrictions of a QMessageBox an own solution was
    programmed for the disclaimer display at program start.

  * GUI surface partly reworked. OK and Cancel button of some widgets moved to
    a new position where an unwanted press should not happen during normal
    operation.

  * Fonts can use point size or pixel size. Both in parallel is not possible.
    Tried to make more generic the setting of an own font size according to the
    used default (points or pixels).

  * Operation of Flarm alias list modified. A double click on a table column was
    not so easy to execute. Now if a cell is clicked an extra dialog is opened
    to handle the input for that cell. Rows can be selected by clicking the left
    row number button.

  * Zoom issue fixed in help browser.

  * The waypoint default type is set to landmark now, if the waypoint editor is
    opened for waypoint creation.

  * Missing time zone item UTC added to sunset in the arrival display.

  * Method determineFlightStatus of Calculator class modified. The flight status
    detection should now work safer and faster as before.

  * New option skip added to NMEA simulator. This option allows to skip a number
    of lines in a file to be played.

cumulus (2.12.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Build is done now with Qt4.8.0.
  
  * Flight mode wave removed. It is not clearly to decide, when a glider is
    flying in the wave.
  
  * If the IGC logger operates in auto start mode the current flight time is
    displayed now in the flight parameters dialog. This dialog is opened by
    pressing the Mc display box.
  
  * If the IGC logger operates in auto start mode and the flight mode changes
    to unknown or still stand, the logfile is automatically closed after 90s now.
  
  * Wrong entry in file glider.pol fixed.
   
  * Reachable list overworked. Two buttons added for page scrolling. If an entry
    is selected and the list is scrolled no jump more to the selected position
    after a list update. That makes the viewing of the list easier for the user.
   
  * If the flight state is cruising and a target is selected,
    a relative bearing information is displayed at the top of the
    map, if this option is activated in the map object menu.
    The relative bearing information shows the necessary direction
    and the degrees of correction to be made to fly directly to
    the target.
    
  * Wing load value added to pre-flight glider page and to glider polar drawing.
   
  * The navigate to home button function did not set the
    home elevation. That caused a wrong arrival altitude display.
    The problem was difficult to recognize, if the home site
    elevation is low. But in Gariep Dam in South Africa I
    detected the issue because it lays ca. 1300m above MSL.

  * If a target is selected, the drawing of a track line can be
    activated now in the task setup configuration menu. The track
    line shows the current movement direction. So you can easier
    see, if you are on the bearing line to your selected target
    or not.

  * New cross button added to waypoint list view. Pressing the
    button will remove all waypoint entries of the list after
    confirmation. That make it easier and faster to clear the
    whole list as using the select all and remove feature.
    
  * On the Linux desktop the mouse wheel can be used now for zoom actions.
    
  * Map type highway renamed to motorway according to OSM usage.
    
  * Waypoint import routine for cup files enhanced, that also
    runway length values can be handled using unit feet. That is
    not conform to the SeeYou specification but I saw that in
    a south African waypoint file.
    
  * The type of an user added waypoint by pressing the bearing
    icon was changed from turnpoint to landmark. The middle
    position of a square is better to see at the map as a lot of
    flags.
    
  * The first airspace of an airspace file was never loaded. It is fixed now.
    
  * SeeYou waypoint import filter modified.
    
  * Disclaimer tabulator added to AboutWidget.
    
  * Added a new button to the FLARM radar view to make it easier
    to add alias names for hexadecimal Flarm Identifiers. A
    selected Flarm object can be assigned an alias name now by
    using the plus button.
    
  * City labels are drawn at the map now, if the scale is less
    than 100. But some of the city labels are wrong. That seems
    to be a problem in the KFLog data base.

  * New configuration option Save NMEA Data added to GPS settings page. The
    received NMEA data can be stored in a file now for later analysis.
  
  * Map can be moved now by pressing left mouse button and mouse move to a new
