cumulus (2.12.0) stable; urgency=low

  * New cross button added to waypoint list view. Pressing the
    button will remove all waypoint entries of the list after
    confirmation. That make it easier and faster to clear the
    whole list as using the select all and remove feature.
    
  * On the Linux desktop the mouse wheel can be used now for
    zoom actions.
    
  * Map type highway renamed to motorway according to OSM
    usage.
    
  * Waypoint import routine for cup files enhanced, that also
    can be handled runway length values using unit feet. That is
    not conform to the SeeYou specification but I saw that in
    a south African waypoint file.
    
  * The type of an user added waypoint by pressing the bearing
    icon was changed from turnpoint to landmark. The middle
    position of a square is better to see at the map as a lot of
    flags.
    
  * The first airspace of an airspace file was never loaded. It
    is fixed now.
    
  * SeeYou waypoint import filter modified.
    
  * Disclaimer tabulator added to AboutWidget.
    
  * Added a new button to the FLARM radar view to make it easier
    to add alias names for hexadecimal Flarm Identifiers. A
    selected Flarm object can be assigned an alias name now by
    using the plus button.
    
  * City labels are drawn at the map now, if the scale is less
    than 100. But some of the city labels are wrong. That seems
    to be a problem in the KFLog data base.
