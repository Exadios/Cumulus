cumulus (2.12.1) stable; urgency=low

  * All Qt default spinboxes are replaced by own improved solutions.
    That should make the operation more user friendly now.

  * Co-pilot name and current water ballast are saved now, if the
    pre-flight dialog is left with the OK button.

cumulus (2.12.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Build is done now with Qt4.8.0
  
  * Flight mode wave removed. It is not clearly to decide, when a glider is
    flying in the wave.
  
  * If the IGC logger operates in auto start mode the current flight time is
    displayed now in the flight parameters dialog. This dialog is opened by
    pressing the Mc display box.
  
  * If the IGC logger operates in auto start mode and the flight mode changes
    to unknown or still stand, the logfile is automatically closed after 90s now.
  
  * Wrong entry in file glider.pol fixed.
   
  * Reachable list overworked. Two buttons added for page scrolling. If an entry
    is selected and the list is scrolled no jump more to the selected position
    after a list update. That makes the viewing of the list easier for the user.
   
  * If the flight state is cruising and a target is selected,
    a relative bearing information is displayed at the top of the
    map, if this option is activated in the map object menu.
    The relative bearing information shows the necessary direction
    and the degrees of correction to be made to fly directly to
    the target.
    
  * Wing load value added to pre-flight glider page and to glider polar drawing.
   
  * The navigate to home button function did not set the
    home elevation. That caused a wrong arrival altitude display.
    The problem was difficult to recognize, if the home site
    elevation is low. But in Gariep Dam in South Africa I
    detected the issue because it lays ca. 1300m above MSL.

  * If a target is selected, the drawing of a track line can be
    activated now in the task setup configuration menu. The track
    line shows the current movement direction. So you can easier
    see, if you are on the bearing line to your selected target
    or not.

  * New cross button added to waypoint list view. Pressing the
    button will remove all waypoint entries of the list after
    confirmation. That make it easier and faster to clear the
    whole list as using the select all and remove feature.
    
  * On the Linux desktop the mouse wheel can be used now for zoom actions.
    
  * Map type highway renamed to motorway according to OSM usage.
    
  * Waypoint import routine for cup files enhanced, that also
    runway length values can be handled using unit feet. That is
    not conform to the SeeYou specification but I saw that in
    a south African waypoint file.
    
  * The type of an user added waypoint by pressing the bearing
    icon was changed from turnpoint to landmark. The middle
    position of a square is better to see at the map as a lot of
    flags.
    
  * The first airspace of an airspace file was never loaded. It is fixed now.
    
  * SeeYou waypoint import filter modified.
    
  * Disclaimer tabulator added to AboutWidget.
    
  * Added a new button to the FLARM radar view to make it easier
    to add alias names for hexadecimal Flarm Identifiers. A
    selected Flarm object can be assigned an alias name now by
    using the plus button.
    
  * City labels are drawn at the map now, if the scale is less
    than 100. But some of the city labels are wrong. That seems
    to be a problem in the KFLog data base.

cumulus (2.11.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Build is done now with Qt4.7.4
  
  * New waypoint import filter added for import of WinPilot and CAI waypoint
    files with extension .dat.
    
  * New configuration option Save NMEA Data added to GPS settings page. The
    received NMEA data can be stored in a file now for later analysis.
  
  * Map can be moved now by pressing left mouse button and mouse move to a new
    position in manual mode. That works a little bit slow but it works ;-)
