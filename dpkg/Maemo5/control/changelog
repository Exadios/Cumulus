  * Performance issues in GPS status display and GPS data transfer fixed.

  * Communication data transfer between the GPS client and Cumulus process
    optimized. It was to slow, if more than five Flarm devices were received.
    That caused a blocking of the GUI. No reactions more on user requests.

  * Two new features added, waypoint import handling and airspace load
    management.
  * Different bug fixing and optimizations done.
