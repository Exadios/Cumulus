<p><b>Information</b><p>

  Here you can configure the display duration of the information
  windows and the audible alarm signal. The information windows can
  appear automatically (warnings) or if you touch a symbol on the map.
  After given time is expired it will be removed automatically unless
  the time is set to zero. In this case the user must quit the window
  manually by hand touch.
  <p>
  All times are defined in seconds. To make the display duration more
  sensitive with the amount of information to be displayed the real
  time is weighted with them. That means more items to display will
  extend the window stay time.
  <p>
  With the item Warning suppress time you can suppress the same
  airspace warning for a certain time to be defined in minutes
  here. Multiple warnings are generated, if you move between the
  different warning distances, definable under the tabulator Airspace
  e.g. during circling. The value zero switches off the suppression.
  <p>
  An audible alarm can be switched on/off. It is used to emphasize
  special situations like approaching near to airspaces. The general
  default is on.
  <p>
  The Nearst Site Calculator is computing the distances and the
  reachability to the nearst sites in flight. If this feature is
  unwanted, it can be switched off here to spare processing resources.
  <p>
  The botton <i>Reset to defaults</i> can be used to reset all done
  changes to the initial state. The settings here take immediate
  effect, if the OK button is pressed.
