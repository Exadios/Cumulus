    <p><b>Map - Advanced</b></p>

    <p>On this page you can set some advanced map features.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Projection</b></dt>

      <dd>The raw maps Cumulus uses are not projected. Therefore, they
      are projected on first loading. There are many types of map
      projections available. You need a projection because the earth
      is a sphere (or close to it, anyway) and your map is flat.
      
      <p>Cumulus supports two projections:
      
      <ul>
        <li><i>Plate Car&eacute;e</i> - Equidistant Cylindrical Projection
        <li><i>Lambert</i> - Conical Orthomorphic Projection
      </ul>
    
       The former is computationally simpler, and thus preferred in
       most situations. The latter is more complex, so your maps will
       take much longer to load. It is however more realistic.</p>
    
       <p>Each map projection needs a basis from where to work. For
       the <i>Plate Car&eacute;e</i> projection, choose a parallel
       close to your home base. For <i>Lambert</i> projection you
       should select should select the parallels so that they are
       covering the area you are flying. For example, you could choose
       the parallels from your official flying map. Then you will have
       an equal look like these maps.  You should select the longitude
       from the middle of the area you are flying. It is needed
       because of some technical reasons, not for the projection
       itself.</p>
    
      <p>After changing the projection kind or the standard parallel
      values, Cumulus will need to recompile your map files. <b>Please
      note that:</b> If you don't set the projection options
      correctly, you will likely end up with a blue screen or oddly
      deformed map. This is especially so if you are far away from the
      coordinates used in the projection. If you are on a different
      hemisphere, you will need to change your projection!</p>
      </dd>

      <a name="Welt2000Filter"></a>

      <dt><b>Welt 2000 Country Filter</b></dt>

      <dd>Here you can define the countries to be read from the Welt
      2000 file. Several countries can be entered here as list
      separated by commas or spaces. The country identifiers have to
      be coded according to ISO-3166. If you define countries here,
      you should not do the same in the configuration file of
      welt2000.conf. The definitions from the GUI surface will
      overwrite the FLITER rule in the configuration file.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Welt 2000 Radius Filter</b></dt>

      <dd>As alternative to the country filter you can define a radius
      around your home position. All airfields laying inside this
      radius will be read from welt 2000 data file. This option is
      only available, when no country filter has been setup. If the
      radius is zero, then internally a radius of 1000 Kilometers is
      assumed.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Welt 2000 Data Reload</b></dt>

      <dd>If the home position or the configuration are modified,
      cumulus will trigger an automatic reload of welt 2000 data.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Map Deletion</b></dt>

      <dd>Cumulus can save space by deleting the original maps once
      they are projected. It is a good idea to do so if you don't need
      to adjust your projection after you initially set it. Otherwise
      you have to reinstall the original map files.
      </dd>
    
      <dt><b>Map Management</b></dt>
    
      <dd>Cumulus supports two strategies for keeping maps in
      memory. Maps are only loaded if needed, but they can
      either stay there until they really need to be moved
      out of memory, or they can be removed sooner. The
      former stategy is more suited for users who want to
      zoom in and out a lot and have plenty of memory in
      their device, the latter stategy is to be recommended
      for people with lower memory devices. Check
      <i>Immediately unload unneeded maps</i> if you want to
      use the second strategy.
