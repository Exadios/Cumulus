<h3 align="center">Preflight Task</h3>

<p>This window is split into two subwindos. In the upper window
you can see all defined tasks by you. Clicking on a task will select it
and display the details in the lower window. In the speed box in the
upper left corner you can enter a speed you want to fly. This spped is
used for the time calculation in the displayed task.</p>
<p>If you leave the menu with
the OK button, the selected task is treated as to fly now. In this case
the task is drawn on the map. To activate the automatic task point
switch, you have to select in the task view the first approach point by
hand. If you select the first approach point already on ground and move
faster than 35 Km/h the automatic switch to the next task point will
become active. </p>

<p> If you approach into the sector described by the task point
switch radius, the next task point is selected automatically. The task
point switch behaviour can be configured in <a href="cumulus-settings-sector.html">
Settings Sector</a>.</p>

<p> A selected task can be removed or edited by clicking on the
related icons in the right upper corner of the window. If you want to
define a new task, click on the editor icon. This will open a new
screen, where you can select waypoints and airfields from a toggle list
to be used for task definition. Use the arrows for moving up/down
waypoints or to the change the order of the task points.
