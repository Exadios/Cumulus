<h3 align="center">Preflight Task</h3>

<p>Here you have the possibility to define your flight tasks. The
window is split into two subwindos. In the upper window you can see all
defined tasks by you. Clicking on a task entry will select it and
display the details in the lower window. In the upper line you can see
different spin boxes. In one of them you can enter your true air speed
TAS you want to fly. Also wind direction and wind speed can be entered.
If TAS and wind speed are greater than zero they will be included in the
task calculation. In this case you can see under the column TH (true
heading) the course to be flown to reach the next target. In the other
case the column is named TC (true course). That means wind speed or TAS
are zero. If wind triangle calculation fails, you will also see the
column TC (true course). In such a case wind correction angle (WCA) and
ground speed (GS) are set to a dash.</p>

<p>If you leave the menu with the OK button, the selected task is treated as
to fly now. In this case the task is drawn on the map. To activate the automatic
task point switch, you have to select in the task view the first approach point
by hand. Alternatively you can use the shortcut key <b>b</b> to do that. But
note the difference. The shortcut key <b>b</b> will always select the first
approach point of a flight task whilst in the task view you can select any
point. If you could not touch a task point sector or cylinder you must select by
hand the next task point. There is no automatic switch done to the next point as
some GPS devices are doing.

<br>
If you select the first approach point already on ground and move faster than 35
Km/h the automatic switch to the next task point will become active.</p>

<p> If you approach into the sector described by the task point
switch radius, the next task point is selected automatically. The task
point switch behaviour can be configured in <a href="cumulus-settings-sector.html">
Settings Sector</a>.</p>

<p>A selected task can be removed or edited by clicking on the related icons
in the right upper corner of the window. If you want to define a new task, click
on the editor icon. This will open a new screen, where you can select waypoints,
airfields and outlanding points from a toggle list to be used for task
definition. Use the arrows for moving up/down of task points or to the change the
order of the task points.
