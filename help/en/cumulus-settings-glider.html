<p><b>Gliders</b></p>

<p>
	Cumulus supports multiple gliders you can configure. So you can choose the glider you will be using for
	a particular flight from a list and have all relevant data available instantly. Using the buttons above
	the list, you can add (paper icon), edit (map icon) or delete (trashcan icon) gliders from your
	list. Like with other settings, changes are stored only if you exit the settings dialog with the OK 
	button. If you accidentally delete a glider from you list, just hit the cancel button or the little x and
	you'll be fine.</p>


	
<p>
    If you tab the add or edit button, you'll be presented with a new dialog. 
	Here you can enter information about your glider. The polar is used for final glide calculations. Select
    your glider from the list or enter the correct values for your glider in the boxes. The values represent
    three points on your gliders polare, that are used to make an approximation of this polare. These points
    are represented as pairs of speed (in km/h) and rate of sink (in m/s). 
    For optimal results, take the speed for the best L/D as the first point,
    a value between 170 km/h and Vne as the third, 
    and a point halfway in between these as the second point.
    </p>


    
<p>    
    If your glider can take on water ballast, enter the capacity in liters. You can enter the amount you
	actually take with you on a flight in the preflight dialog.
    </p>


    
<p>
    You can see a graphical representation of the resulting polar if
    you select the <i>Show Polar</i> button. Included in this display
    is information on the best speed and L/D for the selected
    glider. With the cursor rocker you can simulate wind and lift by
    pressing the up/down (lift) and left/right (wind) buttons. The
    related tangent is calculated, the best speed and the resulting
    sink is displayed accordingly. With the center key you can reset
    all to the defaults.
    </p>


    
<p>
    To add your own types to the selection list, please edit the file
    <i>glider.pol</i> located at /opt/cumulus/etc.
    </p>


    
<p>
    The values for registration and call sign are used in the logfiles
    and as a unique identifier for the glider.
