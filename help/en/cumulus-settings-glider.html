  <h4>Gliders</h4>

	Cumulus supports multiple gliders that you can configure. You can then choose 
	the glider you will be using for a particular flight from a list and have all 
	the relevant data instantly available. Using the buttons above the list, you 
	can add (paper icon), edit (pencil icon) or delete (trashcan icon) gliders 
	from your list. As with other settings, changes are only stored if you exit 
	the settings dialog with the OK (green with the white tick) button. If you 
	accidentally delete a glider from your list, just tap the cancel (red with 
	the white x) button and you'll be fine.
	
  <p>
  If you tap the add or edit buttons, you'll be presented with a new dialog. 
	Here you can enter information about your glider. The polar is used for the 
	final glide calculations. Select your glider from the list or enter the 
	correct values for your glider in the boxes. The values represent three points 
	on your glider's polar; these are used to make an approximation to this curve.
	These points are given as pairs of speed (in km/h) and rate of sink (in m/s). 
	For optimal results, take the values at the speed for best L/D as the first point,
	V<sub>Ne</sub> as the third, and a point halfway between these as the second point.
  Note that the boxes for "Added load" and 
	"Max. water" are only intended for use in checking what the polar would look like 
	at the all-up weight given by Empty weight + Added load + Max water. They do not
	affect the in-flight speed-to-fly or gliding angle calculations. However, if your
	glider can carry water, leave the full amount entered here, as this value will limit
	the actual amount you can enter on the
	<a href="cumulus-preflight-settings-glider.html">
	Preflight Settings/Glider</a>
	menu page. The actual Added load is also entered on the same page.
  </p>
 
  <p>
	You can see a graphical representation of the resulting polar if you
	select the <i>Show Polar</i> button. Included in this display is
	information on the speed for the best L/D for the selected glider. Using
	the cursor rocker you can simulate wind and lift by pressing the up/down
	(lift) and left/right (wind) buttons. The related tangent is calculated,
	and the best speed-to-fly and resulting sink are displayed accordingly.
  </p>

  <p>
	To add your own types to the selection list, please edit the file
	<i>glider.pol</i> located at /opt/cumulus/etc. But better would be to send
	your polar data to the Cumulus team for insertion into that file.
  </p>

  <p>
	The values for registration and call sign are used in the IGC logfile
	and as a unique identifier for the glider.
