	<dl>

		<dt>
			<b>Airspace Table</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>
			The table shows you which kind of airspaces can be drawn on the map.
			Mark the boxes of the airspaces you want displayed. To change the
			colour of the airspace border or the airspace area, touch on the
			related field in the table. This will open a colour dialog. Pressing
			the <i>Color Defaults</i> button will assign the programmed default
			colours to all the airspaces.

			<p>
				<b>Caution!</b> Warnings are only generated for airspaces which are
				enabled in the table.
			</p>
		</dd>

		<br>
		<dt>
			<b>Ignore AS</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>
			If you enable the checkbox <i>Ignore AS</i>, you can setup a vertical
			border in the spinbox at which an airspace is ignored, if its lower
			limit lays over the predefined vertical border. The border value uses
			the unit FL (Flight Level). This feature allows you to filter out
			upper airspaces and to reduce the drawn items at the map.
		</dd>

		<br>
		<dt>
			<b>Install Airspace (only desktop version)</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>
			The <i>Install Airspace</i> button opens a new dialog box, in which
			you can enter an url pointing to an airspace file. The url must
			consist of the following items:

			<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Scheme, such as <i>http</i></li>
				<li>Hostname</li>
				<li>Pathname</li>
			</ol>
			</p>

			If one of these is missing, the url is rejected. Furthermore, the
			file to be downloaded must be a normal file, not compressed, and must
			carry the extension <i>.txt</i> to enable it to be read in after
			download.
		</dd>

		<br><a name="openAir_Load"></a>
		<dt>
			<b>Airspace Load</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>
			The <i>Airspace load</i> button enables you to switch on or off the
			loading of airspace data files contained in the <a
				href="cumulus-maps.html">airspace directory</a>. It opens a table
			where all available airspace data files are listed. At the left side
			of every table row beside the file name is located a checkbox. With
			the help of this checkbox you can switch on (checkbox is checked) or
			switch off (checkbox is unchecked) the corresponding file load. If
			you want to activate the load of all files, enable the checkbox in
			the upper first row with the title <i>Select all</i>. Please note! To
			make single selections the checkbox <i>Select all</i> must be
			unchecked. Leaving window with <i>Ok</i> triggers immediately a
			reload of the airspace data, if something has been changed.
		</dd>

		<br>
		<dt>
			<b>Airspace Warnings</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>
			You will get an optical and acoustical warning if you are near, very
			near or inside the specified airspace If you press the button <i>Airspace
				Warnings</i> you can set the lateral and vertical distances (separately
			for above and below) that will be applied when generating warnings.
			If the distance to an airspace is smaller than the specified values,
			the position is considered <i>near</i> or <i>very near</i> to the
			airspace.
			<p>
				The units used for the vertical and horizontal proximity distances
				can be configured on the <a href="cumulus-settings-units.html">Setting/Units</a>
				page. <br> The display duration of warnings and their
				suppression for a certain time can be configured on <a
					href="cumulus-settings-information.html">Settings/Information</a>
				page.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Note that Cumulus will only warn you for airspaces that are
					drawn unless you have activated the check box <i>Draw all
						airspaces ... above me.</i>
				</b>
			</p>
		</dd>

		<dt>
			<b>Airspace Filling</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>
			The <i>Airspace filling</i> button enables you to switch on or off
			the changing of the airspace fill colour according to the glider's
			proximity. As you get closer to the airspace vertically or
			horizontally, the transparency of the airspace fill colour changes,
			the percentage amount of change being set by the table according to
			whether you are near, very near or inside the airspace in question.
			If you disable the airspace filling, a fixed pattern is used for
			filling.
