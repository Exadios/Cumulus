<h3 align="center">Tasks</h3>

<p>Tasks are routes between waypoints which are handled as
turnpoints here. They can be created and modified in the Pre-Flight
setting dialog under the <a href="cumulus-preflight-settings-task.html">tabulator
task</a>. The task is drawn on the map using a dark magenta line with
clearly marked turnpoint sectors. The turnpoint sectors can be
configured under <a href="cumulus-settings-sector.html">Cumulus
Settings Sector</a>. Currently only <i>classic</i> tasks are supported.
Support for newer task types, start lines, etc. will be added in a
future version.</p>

<p>
A task comprises at least four waypoints. That is also the minimum if you will
fly a direct route. The used points have the following names in the display:

<ul>
  <li>Takeoff - take off place</li>
  <li>Begin - here starts the task</li>
  <li>Route - one or more route points, can be omitted for a direct route</li>
  <li>End - here ends the task</li>
  <li>Landing - landing place</li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> Takeoff and Begin also End and Landing can be the same points.
If you will fly a direct route no route points have to be defined.
</p>

<p>Tasks can be edited too with KFLog on the Linux desktop, where you can more
easily maintain the list.
ATM Cumulus supports only one task file. This file is installed under
your selected <i>Data Directory.</i>
As task file name must be used <i>tasks.tsk</i>. This is a hard coded name.
Please make only task file transfer between your desktop and
your PDA when Cumulus is not running. Otherwise the results are undefined.</p>
