<h3 align="center">Display</h3>

<p> The main view of Cumulus consists of three information areas, displays containing flight information, a map and a status
bar. This screen is also called the map view.</p>

<p> <b>Flight information</b></p>

<p> The indicators on the left side indicate: </p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Trk</b> - Track (also indicated by the
direction of the glider symbol)</li>

  <li><b>Brg</b> - Bearing to target. Tipping on
number shows for five seconds with red background the reverse course.</li>

  <li><b>Arrow</b> - Bearing to target relative to the current heading. 
      Tipping on icon will save the current position as waypoint.</li>

  <li><b>Dis/Eta</b> - Distance respectively
estimated time of arrival to selected target. Tip on label to toggle
display.</li>

  <li><b>Gs</b> - Current ground speed</li>

  <li><b>Msl/Agl/Std</b> - Current Altitude above
MSL/AGL and Standard pressure. Tip on the number to toggle the display.</li>

  <li><b>Arv</b> - Arrival Altitude above (positive)
or below (negative) about selected target <a href="#glidepath">
(see glide path)</a> </li>

  <li><b>To</b> - Selected target and in parentheses
its elevation. Tip on label to select another target. </li>

  <li><b>Var</b> - Variometer display derived from
gps altitude. Tip on label brings up a dialog box where you can change
the integration time. </li>

  <li><b>Wd</b> - Wind speed and direction.
Wind&nbsp;display can be toggled with LD display. Tip on label Wd
will toggle the display.</li>

  <li><b>LD</b> - Required and current LD to selected
target. Can be toggled with Wind&nbsp;display. Tip on label LD will
toggle the display. <a href="#ld"> See also LD paragraph
for more info.</a> </li>

  <li><b>Mc</b> - McCready value used for glide path
and best speed calculation. Tip to open the in flight dialog.</li>

  <li><b>S2f</b> - Best airspeed for current
McCready, variometer and wind information</li>

</ul>

Of course, all information are displayed in the units you selected in
the <a href="cumulus-settings-units.html">Units Settings</a>
dialog.
<p><b>Map</b></p>

<p> The map displays a graphical representation of the current
position (indicated by the intersection of the fuselage and the wings
in the glider symbol) and heading (indicated by the rotation of the
glider symbol). If there is no GPS fix, Cumulus displays an X symbol in
stead of a glider. See <a href="cumulus-manual.html">
manual navigation mode</a> for more details. The current scale is
displayed in the scale indicator in the lower right corner of the map.<br>

<br>

The map shows the terrain elevation by using colors. The detail level
of this display changes with the zoom factor: more zoom is more detail
in the terrain shapes. You can turn off the drawing of the elevations
from the <a href="cumulus-settings-map.html">Map Settings</a>
dialog.<br>

<br>

Depending on the maps you installed, Cumulus displays airports (the
type is indicated by the standard ICAO symbol), cities (yellow),
highways (red/white), roads (red) and railroads (dark grey), water
(blue). Not all details are displayed in all zoom factors. Also Cumulus
displays airspace structures. The different types are indicated by
using different colors. For basic information on an airport or airspace
structure simply touch the related symbol or area on the screen. You
will get displayed then the info on the interesting object in a pop up
window. The window disappears after a certain time automatically. This
time behaviour can be configured more in detail in the menu <i>General
Setup</i> under the tab <a href="cumulus-settings-information.html">Information</a>.
<br>

If you press an airfield icon, you will get detailed information
on this item. You can add airfields to your waypoint list if it isn't
in the list already. Added waypoints will have a <i>normal</i>
priority. <br>

Cumulus can calculate what airfields or waypoints are in reach. These
waypoints get a green circle beneath them. If a point is within reach
below the entered safety altitude, it gets a magenta circle beneath it.
The line to the currently selected waypoint is colored to match, and
will be in red if the waypoint is not within reach. </p>

<p><b>Status bar</b></p>

<p> The status bar displays the following things:</p>
<p>The first item with the name <span style="font-style: italic;">Menu</span> toggles the menu bar by tipping on it.</p>
<p>The second items tells
the mode Cumulus is operating in. If no GPS connection has been
established this item will set to <i>Man</i>. Otherwise it will
set to <i>GPS</i> and the number of received satellites.</p>

<p> The third item in the status bar is a combination between
logging and flight indicator. It displays at the left side a <i>L</i>
if igc-logging is enabled. <i>Ls</i> is displayed if the
logger is in standby mode. The indicator will light up bold every time
an entry is made. The flight status symbol is either shown in the
center of the box alone, if logging is not active or right beside of
the logging indicator. </p>

<p>The following characters are used for flight state display: </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>?</b> - Unknown </li>
  <li><b>C</b> - Cruising </li>
  <li><b>L</b> - Circling Left </li>
  <li><b>R</b> - Circling Right </li>
  <li><b>S</b> - Standstill </li>
  <li><b>W</b> - Wave </li>
</ul>

The fourth item in the status bar indicates the current position in
longitude and latitude.<br>
<br>
The fifth item shows the selected glider.<br>
<br>
The last item is used as display for warnings and other information.
<p> If you want to maximize the screen area for the map display,
you can disable the status bar via the menu entry <i>View/Statusbar</i>.
</p>

<p><b>Glide path</b></p>

<p><a name="glidepath"> The glide path indicator
gives you an estimation on whether or not your selected target is in
reach. It calculates the performance of your glider using the entered
polar-values on the Settings dialog's </a><a href="cumulus-settings-glider.html">Glider tab</a>. It
is assumed that you fly at the indicated best airspeed for the current
McCready value. You can enter a minimal arrival altitude on the <a href="cumulus-settings-personal.html">Personal tab</a>.<br>

If the indicator shows a negative value, you are under glide path and
the target is not in reach. If you are above glide path, the target is
in reach, and you can probably fly a bit faster to reach it sooner,
depending on the polar of your glider.</p>

<p><b>LD-Display</b></p>

<p><a name="ld"> Becide the glide path indicator you
can check too with the LD display, if you are on the right way.
Precondition for the LD calculation is, that you have selected a target
otherwise nothing is displayed. The LD display consists of two values,
devided by a slash. On the left side the required LD to the selected
target is displayed. Safety altitude and elevation of the target are
considered in the calculation. On the right side the current LD is
displayed calculated over the last 60s. If the current LD is higher as
the required LD you should be on a safe way to your selected target.
When you have climbed or you could fly on the same altitude level in
the last 60s the display shows a value like <i>&gt;99</i>.
If the calculation result is not sensefull, a dash is shown as result
in the display.</a></p>
