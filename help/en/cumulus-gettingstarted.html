<h3 align="center">Getting Started</h3>

To take full advantage of
Cumulus, you need a PDA with a GPS receiver and a set of map files.
Currently Cumulus supports the hardware devices Nokia Internet Tablet
N800/N810 with Maemo OS2008. It can also run on a Linux desktop under
X11/Qt4.
<dl>

<dt><b>PDA</b></dt>

<dd> As long as the program runs on the PDA and you are in move
( &gt; 5 Km/h) the automatic shutdown of the screen to save battery
life is deactivated. If you move slower the screen is switched off
after your programmed time. If you move faster the screen is
automatically switched on. For operation over several hours you need to
supply external power to your PDA. </dd>

<dt><b>GPS</b></dt>

<dd> You can use any GPS receiver or a bluetooth mouse that can
be hooked-up to your PDA and outputs NMEA data records, either by using
a serial or a bluetooth connector. Cumulus can be used without a GPS
receiver but is far more usefull with such a device.<br>

Once you manage to connect your GPS to Cumulus select the correct
device and baud rate in the <a href="cumulus-settings-gps.html">GPS
Settings</a>.
Refer to your GPS manual for the correct settings.
For most serial devices device <i>/dev/ttyS0</i> will do,
for bluetooth <i>/dev/rfcomm0</i> is
most common. The default NMEA connection speed
is 4800 bps, for bluetooth we recommend to use 115200 bps.

<p>If you have a Nokia Internet Tablet N800/N810 it is not necessary
to setup a GPS device or anything else. Available devices will be recognized
automatically during startup of cumulus.
<p>

Press <b><i>G</i></b> or&nbsp;click on
      the GPS status indicator in the statusbar to check the GPS status,
if your GPS device is setup. With the Escape key you can leaf the GPS status
page.
</dd>

<dt><b>Personal</b></dt>

<dd>Define in Personal Settings a data directory, where your
data files containing waypoints, tasks and logger data are to store.
Recommend is a place on the MMC (Mulitmedia Card). See <a href="cumulus-settings-personal.html">Personal Settings</a>
for more details.
</dd>

<dt><b>Glider</b></dt>

<dd>Define in Glider Settings your preferred gliders. See <a href="cumulus-settings-glider.html">Glider Settings</a>
for more details.
</dd>

<dt><b>Maps</b></dt>

<dd> Cumulus uses the same maps as <i>KFLog</i> the KDE Flight Logger.
Download the maps, airspaces and airfields you need and install them on
your PDA. See <a href="cumulus-maps.html">Maps</a> for
more information.
</dd>

<dd>Define in <a href="cumulus-settings-map-settings.html">Map Settings</a> a
data directory for your maps on the MMC and install all there. Furthermore set
the Standard Parallels of the projection to a value near your home position to
get unskewed draw results. </dd>
<dt><b>Waypoints</b></dt>

<dd> Cumulus uses waypoints to facilitate navigation. You can
either edit waypoint files on the PDA or prepare them on the desktop
using <i>KFLog</i> and transfer them to the PDA. See
<a href="cumulus-waypoints.html">waypoints</a> for more
details on waypoints. 
</dd>

<dt><b>Tasks</b></dt>

<dd> Cumulus supports also the definition of flight tasks. You
can either edit the task file on the PDA or prepare them on the desktop
using <i>KFLog</i> and transfer them to the PDA. See <a href="cumulus-preflight-settings-task.html">tasks</a>
for more details on tasks.
