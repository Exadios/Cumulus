<h3 align="center">Getting Started</h3>

To take full advantage of Cumulus, you need a PDA with a GPS receiver
and a set of map files.
Currently Cumulus supports the hardware devices Nokia Internet Tablet
N800/N810 with Maemo OS2008. It can also run on a Linux desktop under X11/Qt4.
<p>If you start Cumulus it will create all necessary data directories by it
self, if they do not already exist. Furthermore you can be ask once, if you want
to download missing airfield or map files from the Internet. Your decision is
valid until to the termination of the program. If Cumulus is in move, faster
as 5Km/h, no downloads are executed. Do enable the automatic download only,
if you have an active Internet connection running!</p>
<dl>

<dt><b>PDA</b></dt>

<dd> As long as the program runs on the PDA and you are in move the automatic
shutdown of the screen to save battery life is deactivated. If you move slower
the screen is switched off after your programmed time. If you move faster the
screen is automatically switched on. The speed border can be configured in the
<a href="cumulus-settings-look-feel.html#Screensaver">Look&amp;Feel</a>
settings.
<br>
For operation over several hours you need to
supply external power to your PDA. Furthermore it is recommend to switch off
all automatic connection or update attempts (WLAN, version updates, ...) before
take off. Such attempts in the air can block the work of Cumulus for a
while and peeving you with popup dialogs.</dd>

<dt><b>GPS</b></dt>

<dd> You can use any GPS receiver, a bluetooth GPS mouse or a flight logger
that can be connected with your PDA and outputs NMEA data records, either by using
a serial, an USB or a bluetooth connector. Cumulus can be used without a GPS
receiver but is far more useful with such a device.<br>

Once you manage to connect your GPS to Cumulus select the correct
device and baud rate in the <a href="cumulus-settings-gps.html">GPS Settings</a>.
Refer to your GPS manual for the correct settings. The most common decices are:
<p>
<ul>
  <li><i>/dev/ttyS0</i> - RS232 serial device</li>
  <li><i>/dev/rfcomm0</i> - Bluetooth device</li>
  <li><i>/dev/ttyUSB0</i> - USB device</li>
</ul>  
</p>
The default NMEA connection speed is 4800 bps for bluetooth devices it maybe
higher.

<br><br>
If you have a Nokia Internet Tablet N800/N810 it is not necessary
to setup a special GPS decive. Available devices will be recognized
automatically during startup of Cumulus unless you want to connect to a GPS
device via USB. In this case you have to select the USB device in the
GPS configuration tabulator.

<br><br>
Press the key <b><i>G</i></b> or click on the GPS status indicator in the statusbar
to check the GPS status, if your GPS device is setup. With the Escape key you can
leaf the GPS status page.

</dd>

<dt><b>Personal</b></dt>

<dd>Define in Personal Settings the coordinates of your home position the area
where do you fly. The setting is important to get unskewed map draw results!
See <a href="cumulus-settings-personal.html">Personal Settings</a>
for more details.
</dd>

<dt><b>Glider</b></dt>

<dd>Define in Glider Settings your preferred gliders.
See <a href="cumulus-settings-glider.html">Glider Settings</a>
for more details.
</dd>

<dt><b>Maps</b></dt>

<dd> Cumulus uses the same maps as <i>KFLog</i> the KDE Flight Logger.
Download the maps, airspaces and airfields you need and install them on
your Desktop resp. PDA. See <a href="cumulus-maps.html">Maps</a> for
more information. Airfields and map files can be downloaded automatically
by Cumulus, if you enable that during startup.
</dd>

<dt><b>Waypoints</b></dt>

<dd> Cumulus uses waypoints to facilitate navigation. You can
either edit waypoint files on the PDA or prepare them on the desktop
using <i>KFLog</i> and transfer them to the PDA. See
<a href="cumulus-waypoints.html">waypoints</a> for more
details on waypoints. 
</dd>

<dt><b>Tasks</b></dt>

<dd> Cumulus supports also the definition of flight tasks. You
can either edit the task file on the PDA or prepare them on the desktop
using <i>KFLog</i> and transfer them to the PDA.
See <a href="cumulus-preflight-settings-task.html">here</a>
for more details on tasks.
