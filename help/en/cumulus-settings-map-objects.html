<p><b>Map Objects</b></p>
<p>
    Here you can choose the items for the display of the map</p>
<p>
    If you experience problems with memory consumption or if you just wish to decrease the amount of
    information displayed on the map, you can choose to turn off some items on the map. These
    items will then not be loaded anymore. You should restart Cumulus after changing these options,
    because the options are only effective for newly loaded maps.
    </p>

<p>Disabling objects for loading will increase map drawing speed and lower the memory consumption.</p>


    
<p>Disabling the loading of isolines will also increase loading
speed. If you enable this option the background of the map will be
colored according to elevation. This coloring will be more detailed if
you zoom in, and less detailed if you zoom out. Note that the isolines
are needed if you want to use features that use ground elevation!</p>
    
<p>Disabling the drawing of waypoint labels will turn of waypoint labels on the map by
      default, but you can toggle the display by pressing <b><i>A</i></b> at any time in
      the mapview.</p>


    
<p>The bearing line is a line from your current position to your
selected target. It is drawn in different color, if a glider
has been selected according to the reachability of the selected target.</p>
