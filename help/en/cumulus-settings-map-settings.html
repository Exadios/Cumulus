<p><b>Map - Settings</b></p>

<p>On this page you can set the maps storage location and the map
basic data.</p>

<dl>

  <dt><b>Maps</b></dt>

  <dd> As loaction for the map data for Maemo (Nokia Internet
Tablet) you
should define a directory on one of the MMCs. With the help of
the button <i>Maps</i> you can open a directory selection
dialog and
navigate to the MMC locations (/media/mmc...) In the text field beside
the button you can
see your done selection. You can modify the text field also by hand and
set so your preferred location. </dd>

  <dt><b>Projection</b></dt>

  <dd>The raw maps Cumulus uses are not projected. Therefore,
they are projected on first loading. There are many types of map
projections available. You need a projection because the earth is a
sphere (or close to it, anyway) and your map is flat.
    <p>Cumulus supports two projections: </p>

    <ul>

      <li><i>Plate Carr&eacute;e</i> - Equidistant
Cylindrical Projection </li>

      <li><i>Lambert</i> - Conical Orthomorphic
Projection </li>

    </ul>

    <p>The former is computationally simpler and thus preferred in most
situations. The latter is more complex, so your maps will take much
longer to load. It is however more realistic.
    </p>
    <p>Each map projection needs a basis from where to work. For
the <i>Plate Carr&eacute;e</i> projection, choose a
parallel close to your home base. For <i>Lambert</i>
projection you should select should select the parallels so that they
are covering the area you are flying. For example, you could choose the
parallels from your official flying map. Then you will have an equal
look like these maps. You should select the longitude from the middle
of the area you are flying. It is needed because of some technical
reasons, not for the projection itself.</p>

After changing the projection kind or the standard
parallel values, Cumulus will need to recompile your map files. <b>Please
note that:</b> If you don't set the projection options correctly,
you will likely end up with a blue screen or oddly deformed map. This
is especially so if you are far away from the coordinates used in the
projection. If you are on a different hemisphere, you will need to
change your projection! </dd>

  <dt><b>Map Deletion</b></dt>

  <dd>Cumulus can save space by deleting the original maps once
they are projected. It is a good idea to do so if you don't need to
adjust your projection after you initially set it. Otherwise you have
to reinstall the original map files.</dd>

  <dt><b>Map Management</b></dt>

  <dd>Cumulus supports two strategies for keeping maps in memory.
Maps are only loaded if needed, but they can either stay there until
they really need to be moved out of memory, or they can be removed
sooner. The former stategy is more suited for users who want to zoom in
and out a lot and have plenty of memory in their device, the latter
stategy is to be recommended for people with lower memory devices.
Check <i>Immediately unload unneeded maps</i> if you want
to use the second strategy. </dd>
