    <p><b>GPS</b><p> Here you can enter connection information on your
    GPS.  Select the correct device and baud rate for your GPS.
    Please refer to your GPS manual for these values.  For most serial
    devices, device /dev/ttyS0 will do, for Compact Flash /dev/ttyS3
    is most common.  For Blue Tooth devices use /dev/rfcomm0. Cumulus
    can also detect the correct device automaticly for compact flash
    units. Choose <i>CF</i> to autodetect a CF gps. The default NMEA
    connection speed is 4800 bps. If your device not contained in the
    selection list, you can change one of the predefined entries to
    your need.
    </p>

    <p>
    Some gps devices can be initialized by saved position data to find
    a satellite signal more quickly. To enable this check <i>Soft
    start</i>.  If this does not work, a <i>Hard start</i> can be
    forced when Cumulus starts up.  If there are still problems to get
    the device working, a <i>Reset to factory settings</i> can be
    initiated by pressing the button.
    </p>
    <p>
    Most of the GPS devices send MSL (mean sea level) altitudes but
    some send HAE (Height above elipsoid.) If your displayed altitude
    deviate always by a constant factor, try the other setting for
    your GPS. If that will not help, you can select the Altitude
    <i>User</i> mode and add an own altitude correction in the spin
    box below.
    </p>
    <p>Cumulus can provide you with some status information on your
    GPS reception. If you want to know what satelites are in view,
    where they are, how strong their signal is, or if you want to 
    take a look at the raw NMEA stream of your GPS, use the 
    <b><i>G</i></b> key or click on the GPS status indicator in the
    statusbar. This will open a status dialog for the GPS.
    <p>
    Cumulus is able to synchronize the PDA system clock to the GPS
    time, if the option <i>Update system clock</i>is activated. But
    this will only work, if cumulus is running as user root.
