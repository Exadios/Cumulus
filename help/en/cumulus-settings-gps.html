<p><b>GPS</b></p>
<p> Here you can enter connection information on your
    GPS receiver.  Select the correct device and baud rate for your GPS.
    Please refer to your GPS manual for these values.  For most serial
    devices, device /dev/ttyS0 will do.  For Bluetooth devices use /dev/rfcomm0, for N810 use /dev/pts/0. The default NMEA connection speed
is 4800 bps for bluetooth we recommend to use 115200 bps. If your device not contained in the
    selection list, you can change one of the predefined entries to
    your need.
    </p>


    
<p>
    Some gps devices can be initialized by saved position data to find
    a satellite signal more quickly. To enable this check <i>Soft
    start</i>.  If this does not work, a <i>Hard start</i> can be
    forced when Cumulus starts up.  If there are still problems to get
    the device working, a <i>Reset to factory settings</i> can be
    initiated by pressing the button.
    </p>

    
<p>
    Most of the GPS devices send MSL (mean sea level) altitudes but
    some send HAE (Height above elipsoid.) If your displayed altitude
    deviate always by a constant factor, try the other setting for
    your GPS. If that will not help, you can select the Altitude
    <i>User</i> mode and add an own altitude correction in the spin
    box below.
    </p>

    
    <p>Cumulus can provide you with some status information on your GPS
      reception. If you want to know what satelites are in view, where they
      are, how strong their signal is, or if you want to take a look at the
      raw NMEA stream of your GPS, use the <b><i>G</i></b> key or click on
      the GPS status indicator in the statusbar. This will open a status
      dialog for the GPS. The dialog can be closed with the Escape key.
    </p>
<p>
    Cumulus is able to synchronize the PDA system clock to the GPS
    time, if the option <i>Update system clock</i>is activated. But
    this will only work, if cumulus is running as user root. On Nokia
    Internet tablet this will not work.
