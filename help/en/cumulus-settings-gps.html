  <h4 align="center">Settings - GPS</h4>

  <b>GPS</b>

  <p>
  Here you can enter connection information regarding your GPS receiver.
  Select the correct device and baud rate for your GPS if necessary.
  Please refer to your GPS manual for these values.
  </p>

  <p>
  Cumulus can provide you some status information concerning your GPS
  reception. If you want to know what satellites are in view, where they
  are, how strong their signal is, or if you want to take a look at the
  raw NMEA stream of your GPS, use the <b><i>G</i></b> key or click on
  the GPS status indicator in the status bar. This will open a status
  dialog for the GPS. The dialog can be closed with the <b>Escape key</b>
  or with the close button.
  </p>
  <p>
  Note that Cumulus will only accept GPS data sentences with a valid checksum.
  It is also able to process the proprietary sentences emitted by a
  Cambridge, Volkslogger, Flarm or LX device and to process this these data.
  Wind, variometer and MacCready data from such devices
  will be taken over automatically, if they are available. MSL and STD altitude,
  derived from the pressure sensor are only taken on demand.
  </p>

  <dt><b>GPS Device</b></dt>

  <dd>
    In the combo box you can select the device to be used for your
    GPS connection. There are the following devices available:
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Serial devices (RS232) like /dev/ttyS0.
      <li> Bluetooth devices like /dev/rfcomm0
      <li> USB devices like /dev/ttyUSB0
      <li> GPS Location
      <li> NMEA Simulator
    </ul>
    </p>
    Serial and Bluetooth devices need also a speed rate for their
    operation. The default serial NMEA connection speed is 4800 bps for
    Bluetooth we recommend to use 115200 bps.
    <p>
    If you use a Nokia Internet Tablet N800/N810/N900 the entry
    <i>GPS Location</i> should be your first selection unless you want
    to connect via your USB interface adapter to the GPS. In such a
    case select the device <i>/dev/ttyUSB0</i>.
    </p>
    If your device is not contained in the selection list, you can change
    one of the predefined entries to your need.
  </dd>
  
  <br><dt><b>Altitude Reference</b></dt>

  <dd>
    The default selection is GPS. Most of the GPS devices send MSL (mean sea
    level) altitudes but some send HAE (Height above ellipsoid.) If your displayed
    altitude deviate always by a constant factor from the expected value you can
    correct that in the altitude dialog. You can open it by tipping on the
    altitude display at the map view. Add your correction value in the spin box
    labeled with Leveling. Positive values will be added and negative values
    subtracted from the delivered altitude. If a GPS fix is established the
    correction value will be applied immediately.
    <p>
    Some logger devices can deliver altitude values derived from a pressure
    sensor. If you want to use pressure data, you have to select in the Altitude
    Reference combo box the entry <i>Pressure</i>.
    <br><b>Please note!</b> If you have selected the pressure item Cumulus
    expects special NMEA records from the connected logger devices.
    Otherwise you will not get displayed any altitude and variometer data!
    </p>
    
    <p>The following devices are supported by Cumulus:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Cambrigde device: It delivers altitude values (MSL and STD)
        derived from a pressure sensor.
    <li>Volkslogger device: It can deliver the STD altitude derived from a
        pressure sensor. To get the right MSL altitude, you have to setup the
        correct QNH value in the Preflight Settings. Furthermore do enable the
        sending of the PGCS record in the Volkslogger setup menu.
    <li>LX Navigation devices: They deliver also altitude values derived from a
        pressure sensor. Do enable the sending of the LXWP records
        in the LX setup menu. On a LX20 device you have to enter the Password
        menu. Enter the password, default is 96990 and goto the NMEA menu.
        In the NEMA menu set the entry LXWP? to 'Y'. Set the transfer speed in
        Cumulus to 4800 bps. The LX20 device uses this speed for NEMA transfer
        regardless of the selected PC transfer speed.
    <li>FLARM device, hardware version 2 or later: It delivers altitude values
        derived from a pressure sensor. Do enable the sending of the PGRMZ record
        in the FLARM setup menu. 
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Sync Clock</b></dt>

  <dd>
    Cumulus is able to synchronize the PDA system clock to the GPS
    time, if the option <i>Sync Clock</i> is activated. But
    this will only work, if Cumulus is running as user root. On Nokia
    Internet tablet this feature is switched off because user processes
    are not running under the root identity.

  <h4>Processed GPS sentences</h4>

  Cumulus processes the following NMEA and proprietary sentences:
