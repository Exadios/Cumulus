<p><b>GPS</b></p>

<p> Here you can enter connection information regarding your GPS receiver.
    Select the correct device and baud rate for your GPS if necessary.
    Please refer to your GPS manual for these values.
<p>
    Cumulus can provide you some status information concerning your GPS
    reception. If you want to know what satellites are in view, where they
    are, how strong their signal is, or if you want to take a look at the
    raw NMEA stream of your GPS, use the <b><i>G</i></b> key or click on
    the GPS status indicator in the status bar. This will open a status
    dialog for the GPS. The dialog can be closed with the <b>Escape key</b>.

<p> Note that Cumulus will only accept GPS data sentences with a valid checksum.
    It is also able to process the proprietary sentences emitted by a
    Cambridge, Volkslogger or LX device and to process this these data.
    Wind, variometer and MacCready data from such devices
    will be taken over automatically, if they are available. MSL and STD altitude,
    derived from the pressure sonde are only taken on demand.

<dl>
  <dt><b>GPS Device</b></dt>

  <dd>
    In the combo box you can select the device to be used for your
    GPS connection. There are the following devices available:
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Serial devices (RS232) like /dev/ttyS0.
      <li> Bluetooth devices like /dev/rfcomm0
      <li> USB devices like /dev/ttyUSB0
      <li> GPS Location
      <li> NMEA Simulator
    </ul>
    </p>
    Serial and Bluetooth devices need also a speed rate for their
    operation. The default serial NMEA connection speed is 4800 bps for
    Bluetooth we recommend to use 115200 bps.
    <p>
    If you use a Nokia Internet Tablet N800/N810/N900 the entry
    <i>GPS Location</i> should be your first selection unless you want
    to connect via your USB interface adapter to the GPS. In such a
    case select the device <i>/dev/ttyUSB0</i>.
    </p>
    If your device is not contained in the selection list, you can change
    one of the predefined entries to your need. This is unsupported on the
    Nokia Internet Tablet.
  </dd>
  
  <dt><b>Altitude Reference</b></dt>

  <dd>
    Most of the GPS devices send MSL (mean sea level) altitudes but
    some send HAE (Height above ellipsoid.) If your displayed altitude
    deviate always by a constant factor, try the other setting for
    your GPS.
    If that will not help, you can select the Altitude
    <i>User</i> mode and add an own altitude correction in the spin
    box below.
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> If you use a Cambrigde device as GPS source, it delivers also
    altitude values (MSL and STD) derived from a pressure sonde. Shall
    Cumulus work on this base, select the <i>Pressure</i> item
    in the combo box.
    <li> If you use a Volkslogger device as GPS source, it can deliver 
    altitude derived from a pressure sonde. These values are related to STD.
    To get the right MSL altitude, you have to setup the QNH value in the Preflight
    Settings. Shall Cumulus work on this base, select the <i>Pressure</i> item
    in the combo box and enable the sending of the PGCS record in the
    Volkslogger setup menu.
    <li> If you use a LX device as GPS source, it delivers also
    altitude values derived from a pressure sonde. Shall
    Cumulus work on this base, select the <i>Pressure</i> item
    in the combo box and enable the sending of the LXWP records in the
    LX setup menu. On a LX20 device you have to enter the Password menu. Enter
    the password, default is 96990 and goto the NMEA menu. In the NEMA menu set
    the entry LXWP? to 'Y'. Set the transfer speed in Cumulus to 4800 bps. The
    LX20 device uses this speed for NEMA transfer regardless of the selected
    PC transfer speed.
    </ul>
    </p>
    <b>Please note!</b> If you have selected the pressure item in the combo box
     Cumulus expects the special NMEA records from the connected logger devices.
     Otherwise you will not get displayed any altitude and variometer data!   
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Special Options</b></dt>

  <dd>
    Some GPS devices can be initialized by saved position data to find
    a satellite signal more quickly. To enable this check <i>Soft
    start</i>.  If this does not work, a <i>Hard start</i> can be
    forced when Cumulus starts up.  If there are still problems to get
    the device working, a <i>Reset to factory settings</i> can be
    initiated by pressing the button.
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Update system clock</b></dt>

  <dd>
    Cumulus is able to synchronize the PDA system clock to the GPS
    time, if the option <i>Update system clock</i> is activated. But
    this will only work, if Cumulus is running as user root. On Nokia
    Internet tablet this feature is switched off.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Processed GPS sentences</b>
<p>
Cumulus processes the following NMEA and proprietary sentences:
