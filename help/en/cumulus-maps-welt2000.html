	<h3 align="center">Maps - Welt2000</h3>
	<p>
		For airfields and outlandings Cumulus can use as a one possible source the
		<i>Welt2000</i> data base. These data were originally compiled by Michael
		Meier (known as Milomei) as one big file <i>WELT2000.TXT</i> found at
		<a href="http://www.segelflug.de/vereine/welt2000">www.segelflug.de/vereine/welt2000</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Cumulus downloads this file automatically, if it is missing or if it was updated.
	  Furthermore you can execute a download on demand at the
	  <a href="cumulus-settings-points.html#Download">Settings - Point Data</a>
	  page, if you select as source Welt2000 and press the <i>Install</i> button there.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Welt2000 file is installed in the directory <b>.../maps/points</b>.
		It must have the name <i>welt2000.txt</i>. Because a Welt2000 file
		covers the whole world, the amount of data to be read in must be
		limited to only that required. Cumulus provides for this two ways on the
		configuration
    page <a href="cumulus-settings-points.html#Welt2000Filter">
    Settings - Point Data - Welt2000</a>:
	</p>

	<ol>
    <li>
      Filtering by countries.
    </li>
    <li>
      Filtering by a radius around your home position.
    </li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		One disadvantage of Welt2000 is that it recognizes only three types of
		airfield (Airfield, Glider Field, Ultra Light Field), while Cumulus
		recognizes a lot more. This lack can be overcome by additional
		mapping. You can map the short names or ICAO identifiers of the
		Welt2000 file entries onto other Cumulus map elements in a
		configuration file, using the simple syntax shown below. The
		configuration file must have the name <i>welt2000.conf</i> and must be
		located in the same directory as the source file <i>welt2000.txt</i>.
		The file uses the following syntax:
	</p>

	<ul>

		<li>A comment line starts with a <i>#</i> hashmark or a <i>$</i>
			dollar sign and ends with a new line.
		</li>

		<li><b>FILTER countries=</b><i>country_1[,...,country_n]</i> <br>

			This line defines a country filter rule. Several countries can be
			entered after the equal sign in one line as a comma-separated list.
			The country identifiers have to be coded according to ISO-3166. If
			such a rule is defined, only the listed countries will be extracted
			from the Welt2000 source file. As mentioned above, the use of the
			Cumulus GUI now makes this filter method obsolete. It is possible to
			define more than one filter rule.</li>

		<li><b>MAP_SHORT_NAME</b> <i>short-name</i>=<i>map-element-of-cumulus</i>
			<br> This line defines a rule for the mapping of the short name
			(the first six characters from the left) of a Welt2000 entry onto a
			special Cumulus map element.</li>

		<li><b>MAP_ICAO</b> <i>icao-sign</i>=<i>map-element-of-cumulus</i>
			<br> This line defines a rule for the mapping of the ICAO
			identifier of a Welt2000 entry onto a special Cumulus map element.</li>

	</ul>

	The supported Cumulus map elements for airfields are:

	<ul>
		<li>IntAirport</li>
		<li>Airport</li>
		<li>MilAirport</li>
		<li>CivMilAirport</li>
		<li>Airfield</li>
		<li>ClosedAirfield</li>
		<li>CivHeliport</li>
		<li>MilHeliport</li>
		<li>AmbHeliport</li>
		<li>Gliderfield</li>
		<li>UltraLight</li>
		<li>HangGlider</li>
	</ul>

	<b>Remember that the cumulus map elements used in the mapping rules
		are case-sensitive.</b>

	<p>Short example of a welt2000.conf file:</p>

	<p>
		# Example of a welt2000.conf file, starting with a comment line <br>

		$ This is also a comment line <br> # <br> # Now follows a
		country filter definition rule <br> # Only the countries Germany,
		Poland and the Czech Republic will be extracted from the welt2000.txt
		source <br> FILTER countries=de,pl,cz <br> # <br> # Now
		follows an ICAO identifier mapping rule <br> # The German airport
		Berlin-Sch&ouml;nefeld is mapped to an international airport element <br>

		MAP_ICAO EDDB=IntAirport <br> # <br> # Now follows a short
		name mapping rule <br> # The German military airport Holzdorf is
		mapped to a military airport element <br> MAP_SHORT_NAME
		HOLZD1=MilAirport
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Please note the following!</b> If a new welt2000.txt file has been
		installed, the first start-up of Cumulus after that will take a longer
		time (ca. 10-20 seconds) while it extracts the desired data from it.
		Cumulus generates a compressed file of the extracted data reuseable by
		its later runs. This file carries the name <i>welt2000.txc</i> and
		will be reused, as long as none of the following are changed: the
		original source, the configuration file, the map projection or the
		home position. This behaviour minimizes the read-in time after a
		restart.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you make any necessary corrections to the data of the Welt2000
		file, please report all your changes to the team who maintain the
		source. Their email address is to be found in the header part of the
		Welt2000 file or <a href="http://www.segelflug.de/vereine/welt2000/">at
	  this page.</a> We all should help to keep the Welt2000 source up-to-date
		and also remember to thank the guys who do this valuable work.
