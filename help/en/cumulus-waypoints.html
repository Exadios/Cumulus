<h3 align="center">Waypoints</h3>

<p>Waypoints are used in Cumulus to support the navigation. When used in
tasks they also serve as turnpoints. Waypoints can be created or edited
inside cumulus or by using KFLog on the Linux desktop, where you can more
easily maintain the waypoint list.

<dl>
  <dt><b>Waypoint file remarks</b></dt>

  <dd>
		At the moment Cumulus supports only one waypoint file. This file is installed
		under your selected Data Directory. As waypoint file name must be used
		<i>cumulus.kwp</i>. This is a hardcoded name.
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Waypoint file transfer</b></dt>

  <dd>
		You can transfer the waypoint file between your desktop PC and your PDA but
		notice,	that Cumulus is <b>not running</b> during the file transfer.
		That can cause a corrupted file.
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Waypoint list display</b></dt>

  <dd>
		To open the waypoint list tipp at the waypoint display, located at the left
	  upper corner on the map screen. Now you can
		see all your known waypoints sorted in alphabetically order. With different
	  buttons in the window you can modify the waypoint list or do other things.
		
		<p><ul>
		  <li>Press one of the filter buttons above the list to navigate to
		      a certain waypoint.</li>
		  <li>Press the plus button to create a new waypoint.</li>
		  <li>Press the pencil button to edit the selected waypoint.</li>
		  <li>Press the trash button to remove the selected waypoint.</li>
		  <li>Press the house button to set the selected waypoint as your
		      new home position.</li>
		  <li>Press the <b><i>Info</i></b> button to get displayed the details
		      of the selected waypoint. The info screen for a waypoint will close
          automatically after some seconds. Press the <i>Keep</i> button to
          prevent this. The <b><i>New Home</i></b> button sets this waypoint
          as your new home position.</li>
		  <li>Press the Select button to make the selected waypoint to your
		      new target. The hardware keys Return or Select do the same.
		      You may want to use <b><i>V</i></b> after selecting a
          waypoint to ensure it is visible on the map.</li>
		</p></ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Waypoint list filters</b></dt>

  <dd>
		You can narrow down the list of waypoints using the buttons above the
		list. These act as a filter. In only a few steps, you can reduce a list
		of thousands of items to only a few, making it much easier to find the
		waypoint you are looking for.
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Creating a waypoint from the current position</b></dt>

  <dd>
    At any time you can press <i><b>R</b></i> or tipp on the baering icon
    on the map to remember the current position. A waypoint with the name
    <i>WPx-HH:MM</i> will be generated that contains the current coordinates
    and altitude, where <i>HH:MM</i> is derived from the current UTC time.
    The new waypoint is shown in the map display and can be edited in
    the waypoint screen as any other waypoint.
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Waypoint management</b></dt>
  
  <dd>
    If you want to add, modify or delete waypoints use the icons above the
    waypoint list. <b>For security reason it is not recommended to do that
    in flight!</b> If you press new or edit an editor is is opened with entry
    fields for the waypoint properties.
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Waypoint importance</b></dt>

  <dd>
    The <i>importance</i> property deserves some explanation. To prevent
    overcrowding the map with waypoints if you zoom out far, not all waypoints
    are drawn at all zoom factors. You can control which waypoints is to draw by
    selecting the importance.
    If you select <i>high</i> the waypoint will always be drawn. This would
    be appropriate for your home site and other important sites.
    If you select <i>normal</i> the waypoint will be drawn in normal zoom
    modes but not if you zoom out too much and the <i>low</i> importance
    waypoints are only drawn if you zoom in far enough. The currently
    selected waypoint is always visible. In the configuration setup of Map
    Objects you can the define the scale borders for every <i>importance</i>
    property.
    See <a href="cumulus-settings-map-objects.html#WaypointImportance">here</a>
    for more information.
  </dd>
  
  <dt><b>Waypoint runway directions</b></dt>

  <dd>
    In the wayoint editor you have two combo boxes for runway directions. The
    handling of runway directions is a little bit tricky and derived from the
    Welt2000 handling. The following possibilities do exist:
    
    <p><ul>
		  <li><b>09/27</b> means there is one runway with two useable directions.
                <b>Note! The difference between the two directions must be
                always 18.</b>
		  <li><b>09/09</b> means there is one runway with only one useable direction.
		  <li><b>09/18</b> means there are two runways 09/27 and 18/36 with two
                       useable directions.
                       <b>Note! The difference between the two
                       directions must not be equal 18.</b>
    </p></ul>
    
  </dd>
  
  <dt><b>Waypoint names and extra information</b></dt>
  
  <dd>
    Via the menu bar entries <i>View->Waypoint lables and extra info</i>
    you can switch on the display of the waypoint names and their
    reachability (distance and arrival altitude) besides their icons,
    if a glider is selected.
    The text labels are drawn at a white background with black letters.
    The currently selected waypoint is drawn revers. If a waypoint
    is land- and reachable the text is drawn bold. <b>The extra information
    distance and arrival altitude are only displayed, if the landable attribute
    of the waypoint is set.</b> If the waypoint is below your safety altitude,
    the text box frame is drawn in red color.
  </dd>
  
  <dt><b>Final glide calculations</b></dt>

  <dd>
    Waypoints are also used for final glide calculations. If you
    plan to use this feature of cumulus, please make sure that you
    <b>correctly enter the position and the elevation</b> of the
    waypoints! Otherwise you will get unpredictable results.
