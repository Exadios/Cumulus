<h3 align="center">Waypoints</h3>


<p>Waypoints are used in Cumulus to aid navigation. When used in
tasks, they also serve as turnpoints. The waypoints can be edited too
with KFLog on the Linux desktop, where you can more easily maintain the list.
ATM cumulus supports only one waypoint file. This file is installed under your selected Data Directory.
As waypoint file name must be used <i>cumulus.kwp</i>. This is a hardcoded name. Please make only waypoint file transfer when cumulus is not running.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>To select a waypoint, press <i><b>W</b></i> to open the waypoint
screen. Highlight the waypoint using the arrows and/or the letter keys
and press <i><b>Space or Center Button</b></i> to select the
highlighted waypoint.</p>


<p>You can narrow down the list of waypoints using the buttons above the
list. These act as a filter. In only a few steps, you can reduce a list
of thousands of items to only a few, making it much easier to find the
waypoint you are looking for.</p>


<p>Use the <b><i>Info</i></b> button to get more info about the
highlighted waypoint. The info screen for a waypoint will close
automatically after 7 seconds. Press <b><i>I</i></b> to hold up the
screen for 7 more seconds, and press <b><i>K</i></b>
to keep the screen open; press <b><i>Space or Center Button</i></b> to
close it.

</p>
<p>The currently selected waypoint is highlighted on the map using a
reversed label. You may want to use <b><i>V</i></b> after selecting a
waypoint to ensure it is visible on the map.</p>


    
<p>If you want to add, modify or delete waypoints use the icons above the waypoint list. 
    <b>It is not recommended that you do this in flight!</b>
    </p>
<p> If you choose
    new or edit, you will be presented a dialog with entry fields for the waypoint's properties. The
    <i>importance</i> property deserves some explanation. To prevent overcrowding the map with waypoints
    if you zoom out far, not all waypoints are drawn in at all zoom factors. You can control which waypoints
    to draw by selecting the importance. If you select <i>high</i>, the waypoint will always be drawn. This would
    be appropriate for your home site and other important sites. If you select <i>normal</i> the waypoint will be
    drawn in normal zoom modes but not if you zoom out too much, and the <i>low</i> importance waypoints are
    only drawn if you zoom in far enough. The currently selected waypoint is always visible.</p>


    
<p>At any time you can press <i><b>R</b></i> to remember the
    current position.  A waypoint with the name <i>WPX HH:MM</i> will
    be generated that contains the current coordinates and altitude,
    where <i>HH:MM</i> is derived from the current UTC time.  The new
    waypoint will show up in the map display and can be manipulated in
    the waypoint screen as any other waypoint.</p>


    
<p>Waypoints are also used for final glide calculations. If you
    plan to use this feature of cumulus, please make sure that you
    correctly enter the position and the elevation of the
    waypoint!</p>
