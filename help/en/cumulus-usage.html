<h3 align="center">In flight usage</h3>

<p>Cumulus permits the use of the keyboard to minimize the use of
the stylus or directly touching the screen while in flight. For N800
user the hareware key support is limited on the available keys. So most
of thefunctions are only&nbsp;accessed by using the menu. The following
keys are defined in GPS mode:  </p>

<ul>

  <li><i><b>W</b></i> - <a href="cumulus-waypoints.html">Select a waypoint</a></li>

  <li><i><b>E</b></i> - Display a list of
reachable points where you can land. </li>

  <li><i><b>O</b></i> - Display a list of
all airfields loaded into Cumulus. </li>

  <li><i><b>I</b></i> - Information on
current waypoint</li>

  <li><i><b>R</b></i> - Remember current
position as waypoint</li>

  <li><i><b>A</b></i> - Toggle display of
waypoint labels</li>

  <li><i><b>S</b></i> - Toggle display
detailed waypoint labels</li>

  <li><i><b>Y or Z</b></i> - Zoom in</li>

  <li><i><b>X</b></i> - Zoom out</li>

  <li><i><b>Cursor right</b></i> - Zoom in</li>

  <li><i><b>Cursor left</b></i> - Zoom out</li>

  <li><i><b>V</b></i> - Zoom to waypoint</li>

  <li><i><b>L</b></i> - Toggle logging</li>

  <li><i><b>T</b></i> - <a href="cumulus-tasks.html">Select task</a></li>

  <li><i><b>P</b></i> - Show Pre-flight
settings dialog</li>

  <li><i><b>F</b></i> - Show In-flight
settings dialog</li>

  <li><i><b>G</b></i> - Show GPS status</li>

  <li><i><b>Cursor up</b></i> - Increase
McCready value</li>

  <li><i><b>Cursor down</b></i> -

</ul>

<p>If you are working in <a href="cumulus-manual.html">manual
navigation mode</a>, there are more keys available to control
Cumulus. See <a href="cumulus-manual.html">here</a>
for more details.</p>

<p>You can also get information on objects on the map by typing
them with the stylus (or your fingernail). Airspace structures and
airfields will display an information box on the screen that contains
basic info on the object selected. If you type and hold an airfield,
you will get detailed information on the selected airfield, just like
you would for the selected waypoint if you press <i><b>I</b></i>.
In this menu you can also add the listed airfield as a new waypoint or
select it as your waypoint.</p>

<p>Use Zoom to waypoint to get the waypoint you selected into
view on the map. Cumulus will try to display the selected waypoint near
to the edge of the map. The selected waypoint's name is displayed in
reverse colors as the other names. Depending on the distance to the
waypoint, the waypoint may be too far away to show on the map because
the zoom factor would exceed it's minimum. In that case, a message is
shown in the bottom of the screen (in the taskbar area). If the
waypoint is too close, the zoom is set to maximum and the waypoint may
be further from the edge than normal.</p>

<p>Waypoint labels may be turned off and on by pressing <i><b>A</b></i>.
The default is set in the Map configuration tab. You can add distance
and projected arrival altitude to the labels by pressing <i><b>S</b></i>.
Normally, the labels just show the waypoint name.</p>

<p>Logfiles are written in accordance to the IGC file standard.
They are placed in the document section, so you can easily transfer
them to your desktop, beam them to your friends or analyze them using <i>KFLog</i>.</p>

<p>Tasks are routes between waypoints, which are handled as
turnpoints here. They can be created and modified in the Pre-Flight
setting dialog under the tabulator task. Tasks stored from there are
automatically shown in the task selection dialog. Tasks are drawn in
thick purple lines, and turn points are drawn with the correct photo
sectors drawn in red and green.</p>

<p>Prior to the flight, you should select the glider you're
flying with and enter the amount of water balast you've taken with you.
You can do that in the Pre-flight settings. On the second tab, you can
select a task.</p>

<p>In-flight settings are values that may change in-flight. These
are the amount of water you still have, the bug factor and the McCready
setting. Press the <b><i>F</i></b> key or
click on the McCready value to show the dialog where you can changes
these values.</p>
