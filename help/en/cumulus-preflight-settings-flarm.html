	<b>Flarm</b>

	<p>
		Here you have the possibility to readout and set several Flarm data. On this
		page you can upload a selected flight task together with its related data
		to the Flarm device.
	</p>

	<h5>Window description</h5>

	In the upper window part are displayed different read only items in the
	<i>Flarm Data</i> panel from the Flarm device. If the fields are filled with <i>???</i>
	no data could be read from the Flarm device. In this case there seems to be no
	active connection available. The abbreviated labels in the <i>Flarm Data</i>
	panel have the following meaning:

  <p>
  <table border="2" cellpadding=5>
  <tr> <td> <b>SN:</b> </td> <td> Serial number </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>RId:</b> </td> <td> Radio Identifier </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>Sv:</b> </td> <td> Severity of issue </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>Err:</b> </td> <td> Error code </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>ODB:</b> </td> <td> Obstacle data base version. Empty, if no data base is installed. </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>HW:</b> </td> <td> Hardware version </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>Sw:</b> </td> <td> Software version </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>Igc:</b></td> <td> IGC version. Empty on none approved IGC Flarms. </td> </tr>
  </table>
  </p>

  <p>
	<b>Note!</b> If Flarm reports an error code in the framed box
	beside the <i>Err:</i> label, you can click on that error code and will get
	a textual	description of the error code.

  <br><dt><b>Priv</b></dt>
  
  <dd>
  Here you can set/unset the so called <i>Stealth mode</i> of the
