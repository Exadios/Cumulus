	<h4>Introduction</h4>

	Cumulus is a well established Open Source flight navigation software
	made for (but not limited to) soaring pilots written in C++. The
	primary hardware targets were Sharp's Zaurus devices and later Nokia's
	Internet tablets. Both are able to run Qt software with relatively
	little adaptation efforts which made it possible to use large parts of
	the desktop flight preparation software
	<i>KFlog</i>, created for the KDE framework. The Android Lighthouse
	project provides a development kit, called
	<i>Necessitas</i>, for integrating Qt C++ applications into the Android
	environment with little or no changes, embedded in as native libraries
	controlled by the JNI API (Java Native Interface).

	<h4>Preconditions</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>The usage of Cumulus on an Android device is only useful with
			a screen resolution of at least 800 x 480 pixels in landscape mode.
			Furthermore we recommend a screen diagonal greater than 4" otherwise
			you have problems to use your fingers for the operation.
		<li>The device must run Android Release 2.2.x (Froyo) or higher.
		<li>The screen should be good readable in sunshine.
		<li>An external storage medium (SD-Card) is needed for storing of
			map and flight data.
		<li>If no internal GPS receiver is available Bluetooth radio or IOIO via USB
      is a must for connection to external GPS devices.
		<li>Optionally your device should provide a possibility to access the
      Internet for map and airfield data downloads.
		<li>During longer flights you need an external power supply.
		<li>A device mount is recommended for usage in flight.
	</ul>

	<h4>Package download and installation</h4>

	The last released package is to find on Google play as

	<a
		href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=cumulus+from+kflog.org&c=apps">Cumulus
		from kflog.org</a>. Download the package and install it on your device.

	<h4>Permissions required by Cumulus</h4>

	Cumulus requires the following Android system permissions:

	<ul>
		<li>Location service updates (GPS)
		<li>Internet access
		<li>Bluetooth and Bluetooth administration
		<li>Wakelock
		<li>Read and write access for the SD-card
	</ul>

	<h4>First startup of Cumulus</h4>

	<p>On the first startup of Cumulus after the installation you should
		have an Internet connection running to download the needed maps and
		the Welt2000 data file. Cumulus ask you for permission before it starts
		any download actions.</p>

	<p>
		It is recommended to setup the font sizes of the GUI and the Menu
		labels to a value, which is optimal adapted to your device. To do
		that, open the menu item <i>General</i> and touch the entry
		<i>Look&amp;Feel</i> in the list. On the page you can see two buttons,
		which will open a font dialog, if you press them. Choose a font size,
		which is optimal adapted to your device. Make only small changes and
		test the results. To get full running a new selected font, it is
		recommended to restart Cumulus. Especially the Menu font should be
		adapted by you, that it is better usable with fingers.
	</p>

	<h4>Configuration of Cumulus</h4>

	<p>
    As first you should setup your home data and the radius around it.
    To do it, make the following actions:
    
    <ul>
    <li>Connect your Android device with the Internet.</li>
    <li>Start Cumulus.</li>
    <li>Press the Android Menu button, then Setup->General, then Personal.
        Add here the name and the coordinates of your home airfield. The
        coordinates are important for the right map download. Leave the page
        by pressing the green Ok button.</li>
    <li>As next press again the Android Menu button, then Setup->General
        and then the tabulator Map Objects. In the last line you can
        define a radius around the coordinates of the displayed center point.
        Press the button install to get download all maps around the center
        point from the Internet.</li>
    </ul>

	The maps and all other data as waypoint files, IGC logger files, flight
	task file, a.s.o are stored at the SD-card of the Android device. If
	your device has already a built in SD-card, this one is normally used.
	To see, which SD-card is used by Cumulus, press the Android Menu
	button, then Setup->General, Personal. Beside the label
	<b>Data Directory</b> the path to the storage directory is listed. You can
	access this directory also from your PC, if you couple your device with it
	  via USB.
	</p>
  
	<p>
		Airspace files have to be installed in <I>/sdcard/Cumulus/maps/airspaces</I>.
		The path <i>/sdcard/...</i> can be another. If that is true, please read the
		previous paragraph.
		You can download the airspace files by using your Internet browser and as
		destination that directory. On the airspace setting page you can
		determine which airspace files should be loaded during run-time by
		Cumulus. In Cumulus you can use <i>OpenAir</i> and <i>openAIP</i> airspace
		files.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		<i>OpenAir</i> airspace files are to find for Germany (Deutschland) on the <a
		href="http://www.daec.de/fachbereiche/luftraum-flugbetrieb/luftraumdaten/">
		DAeC Webpage</a>. Otherwise look <a
		href="http://soaringweb.org/Airspace/HomePage.html">here</a>, if you
		can find something for your country..
	</p>
	
	<p>
	 <a href="http://www.openaip.net">openAIP</a> airspace files can be downloaded
   from the openAIP website, where this project is hosted.
	</p>

	<h4>GPS activation</h4>

	<p>
		When Cumulus is ready with its startup, it will be in a <b>non-GPS</b> mode.
		Do all your flight planning work in this mode. To switch on the GPS,
		press the Android menu button and select the entry <i>GPS on</i>. You
		can choose then between the internal GPS or a GPS connected via Bluetooth or
		via a USB IOIO. A BT GPS must be paired before it can be used by Cumulus.
		Only via Bluetooth radio or USB IOIO you can connect to an external GPS device.
	</p>

	<h4>Menu usage</h4>

	<p>
		Cumulus has two different menus. The Android menu can be opened by
		pressing the Android menu button. It provides some shortcuts to the
		important setup pages of Cumulus and the GPS switch to control the
		mode. To show the application menu, touch the <i>Menu</i> or the <i>S2f</i>
		field at the bottom of the value display area on the left side.
		Touching the little boxes left of the map can open additional dialogs
		for configuration or toggle the display to show another content. Here
		are a short list about all:
    
	<ul>
		<li><b>Menu/S2f</b> Opens the application menu.</i>
		<li><b>Mc</b> Opens the McCready dialog.</li>
		<li><b>Var</b> Opens the Variometer dialog.</li>
		<li><b>Msl</b> Opens the altimeter dialog.</li>
		<li><b>Wd/LD</b> Tooggles the display between wind and distance.</li>
		<li><b>Trk</b> Opens the Flarm radar view.</li>
		<li><b>Brg</b> Tooggles the display between bearing and reverse bearing.</li>
		<li><b>Dis/Eta</b> Tooggles the display between distance and ETA.</li>
		<li><b>Bearing icon</b> Creates a new waypoint at the current
			position (a little black square), if you tip on them.</li>
		<li><b>Arr</b> Opens the list views (tasks, waypoints, reachables, airfields,
      outlandings) and the list with the reachables is displayed.</li>
		<li><b>To</b> Opens the task view, if a task is activated, otherwise
      the waypoint list is displayed..</li>
	</ul>

	</p>

	<h4>Usage note</h4>

	<p>The native Qt GUI part has some restrictions in its usage.
		Therefore some GUI elements, e.g. color dialog, are not optimal to
		operate.</p>

	<p>
		Cumulus provides an online help. Please have a look into it, if you
		have questions about the usage. The <a
			href="http://www.kflog.org/cumulus/documentation/">Online Help</a> is
		also to find on the Cumulus web page in two languages, in English and
		German.
	</p>

    We will help you in every case, if we can.
  </p>

	<h4>Remarks to Android</h4>

	<p>A big problem is the variety of OS releases and that the
		manufacturers can modify the Android OS provided by Google. That can
		cause additional problems during run-time and makes a testing not more
		possible by us on every device and for every OS release. Also the
		native Qt GUI library port for Android is not yet error free.</p>

    Have fun during flying with Cumulus! That are my (<i>Axel
    Pauli's</i>) personal wishes to you. I'm the  maintainer of Cumulus.
