	<h4>Preconditions</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>The usage of Cumulus on an Android device is only useful with
			a screen of at least 800 x 480 pixels in landscape mode. Furthermore
			we recommend a screen diagonal greater than 4" otherwise you have
			problems to use your fingers for the operation.
		<li>The device must run Android Release 2.2.x (Froyo) or higher.
		<li>The screen should be good readable in sunshine.
		<li>An external storage medium (SD-Card) is needed for storing of
			map and flight data.
		<li>If no internal GPS receiver is available Bluetooth radio is a
			must for connection to external BT GPS devices.
		<li>Optional your device should have a Wireless Ethernet
			connection to access the Internet for data downloads.
		<li>During longer flights you need an external power supply.
		<li>A device mount is recommended for usage in flight.
	</ul>

	<h4>Package download and installation</h4>

	The last release package is to find

	<a href="http://www.kflog.org/fileadmin/user_upload/cumulus_snapshots/Android/">here</a>.

	Download the package

	<a href="http://www.kflog.org/fileadmin/user_upload/cumulus_snapshots/Android/Cumulus4Android-release.apk">
  Cumulus4Android-release.apk</a> and install it on your device. Because the
	package is not provided on the Google market, you have to enable the
	installation of non market applications before to get installed
	Cumulus.
	
	<h4>Permissions required by Cumulus</h4>
	
	Cumulus requires the following system permissions:
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Location service updates
	  <li>Internet access
	  <li>Bluetooth and Bluetooth administration
	  <li>Wakelock
	  <li>Read and write access for the SD-card
	</ul>

	<h4>First startup of Cumulus</h4>

	On the first run of Cumulus you should have an Internet connection
	running because Cumulus requires the installation of the
	<i>Ministro</i> App. Ministro is the Qt library distributor. If you
	cancel the installation, Cumulus is not runable. Furthermore the needed
	maps and the Welt2000 data file are automatically dowloaded from the
	KFLog server, if you allow that.

	<h4>Configuration of Cumulus</h4>

	<p>
		If you set your home position and your flying radius you should have
		an Internet connection running that all the required maps can be
		downloaded automatically. The maps and all your other data are
		installed at the SD-card under the root path <i>/sdcard/Cumulus</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Airspace files have to be installed in <I>/sdcard/Cumulus/maps/airspaces</I>.
		You can download them by using your Internet browser and as
		destination that directory.
	</p>

	<h4>GPS activation</h4>

	<p>
		When Cumulus is ready with its startup, it will be in non-GPS mode. Do
		all your flight planning work in this mode. To switch on the GPS,
		press the Android menu button and select the entry <i>GPS on</i>. You
		can choose then between the internal GPS or a Bluetooth GPS. A BT GPS
		must be paired before it can be used by Cumulus. Only via Bluetooth
		radio you can connect external GPS devices.
	</p>

	<h4>Usage note</h4>

	<p>The ported Qt part has some restrictions in its usage. Therefore
		some GUI elements are not optimal to operate.</p>

	<h4>Remarks to Android</h4>

	<p>A big problem is the variety of OS releases and that the
		manufacturers can modify the Android OS provided by Google. That can
		cause additional problems during run-time and makes a testing not more
		possible by us on every device and for every OS release. Also the native Qt
		library port for Android is not yet error free.</p>

	<p>
		If you step in problems with the GUI surface you can install the app <i>Ministro
		configuration tool</i>. In that App you can change the used Qt library
		source. Normally <i>stable</i> is used. Try out <i>testing</i> or <i>unstable</i>
		and see if the observed issue is fixed.
