  <h4>Introduction</h4>

	Cumulus is a well established Open Source flight navigation software
	made for (but not limited to) soaring pilots written in C++. The
	primary hardware targets were Sharp's Zaurus devices and later Nokia's
	Internet tablets. Both are able to run Qt software with relatively
	little adaptation efforts which made it possible to use large parts of
	the desktop flight preparation software	<i>KFlog</i>, created for the KDE
	framework. The Android Lighthouse	project provides a development kit, called
	<i>Necessitas</i>, for integrating Qt C++ applications into the Android
	environment with little or no changes, embedded in as native libraries
	controlled by the JNI API (Java Native Interface).

	<h4>Preconditions</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>The usage of Cumulus on an Android device is only useful with
			a screen resolution of at least 800 x 480 pixels in landscape mode.
			Furthermore we recommend a screen diagonal greater than 4" otherwise
			you have problems to use your fingers for the operation.
		<li>The device must run Android Release 2.2.x (Froyo) or higher.
		
		<li>The screen should be good readable in sunshine.
		
		<li>An external storage medium (SD-Card) is needed for storing of
			map and flight data.
			
		<li>If no internal GPS receiver is available Bluetooth radio is a
			must for connection to external BT GPS devices.
			
		<li>Optional your device should have a Wireless Ethernet
			connection to access the Internet for data downloads.
			
		<li>During longer flights you need an external power supply.
		
		<li>A device mount is recommended for usage in flight.
	</ul>

	<h4>Package download and installation</h4>

	The last release package is to find on Google play as

	<a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=cumulus+from+kflog.org&c=apps">Cumulus from kflog.org</a>.

	Download the package and install it on your device.
	
	<h4>Permissions required by Cumulus</h4>
	
	Cumulus requires the following Android system permissions:
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Location service updates (GPS)
	  <li>Internet access
	  <li>Bluetooth and Bluetooth administration
	  <li>Wakelock
	  <li>Read and write access for the SD-card
	</ul>

	<h4>First startup of Cumulus</h4>

	<p>
		On the first run of Cumulus after the installation you should have an
		Internet connection running because Cumulus requires the installation
		of the <i>Ministro</i> App.
	</p>

	<p>Ministro is a system wide Qt shared libraries installer and
		provider service. It acts as a bridge between your App and the needed
		Qt libraries.</p>

	<p>If you cancel the installation, Cumulus is not runable. So long
		Cumulus is installed at your device you should not remove the Ministro
		App. Otherwise you will be requested to reinstall it.</p>

	<p>Furthermore the needed maps and the Welt2000 data file are
		automatically dowloaded from the Internet, if you allow that.</p>

	<h4>Configuration of Cumulus</h4>

	<p>
		If you set your home position and your flying radius you should have
		an Internet connection running that all the required maps can be
		downloaded automatically. The maps and all other data as waypoint files,
		IGC logger files, flight task file, a.s.o are	installed at the SD-card under
		the root path <i>/sdcard/Cumulus</i>. You can access this directory also
		from your PC, if you couple your device with it via USB.
	</p>
	<p>
		Airspace files have to be installed in <I>/sdcard/Cumulus/maps/airspaces</I>.
		You can download them by using your Internet browser and as
		destination that directory. On the airspace setting page you can determine
		which airspace files should be loaded during run-time by Cumulus.
	</p>

	<h4>GPS activation</h4>

	<p>
		When Cumulus is ready with its startup, it will be in non-GPS mode. Do
		all your flight planning work in this mode. To switch on the GPS,
		press the Android menu button and select the entry <i>GPS on</i>. You
		can choose then between the internal GPS or a Bluetooth GPS. A BT GPS
		must be paired before it can be used by Cumulus. Only via Bluetooth
		radio you can connect to an external GPS device.
	</p>

	<h4>Usage note</h4>

	<p>The native Qt GUI part has some restrictions in its usage. Therefore
		some GUI elements, e.g. color or font dialogs, are not optimal to operate.</p>
		
  <p>Cumulus provides an online help. Please have a look into it, if you have
  questions about the usage. The
  <a href="http://www.kflog.org/cumulus/documentation/">Online Help</a>
  is also to find on the Cumulus web page in two languages, in English and German.
  </p>

	<h4>Remarks to Android</h4>

	<p>A big problem is the variety of OS releases and that the
		manufacturers can modify the Android OS provided by Google. That can
		cause additional problems during run-time and makes a testing not more
		possible by us on every device and for every OS release. Also the native Qt
		GUI library port for Android is not yet error free.</p>

	<p>
		If you step in problems with the GUI surface you can install the App <i>Ministro
		configuration tool</i>. In that App you can change the used Qt library
		source. Normally <i>stable</i> is used. Try out <i>testing</i> or <i>unstable</i>
		and see if the observed issue is fixed.
