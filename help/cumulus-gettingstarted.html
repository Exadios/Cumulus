<h3 align="center">Getting Started</h3> To take full advantage of
Cumulus, you need a GPS receiver and a set of map files.

<dl>
  <dt><b>PDA</b></dt>

  <dd>
   As long as the program runs on the PDA, the automatic shutdown of
   the screen to save battery life is deactivated. For operation over
   several hours you need to supply external power to your PDA.
  </dd>

  <dt><b>GPS</b></dt>
  
   <dd>
    You can use any GPS receiver that can be hooked-up to your PDA and
    outputs NMEA data records, either by using a serial or a blue
    tooth connector or using a Compact Flash receiver. Cumulus can be
    used without a GPS receiver, but is far more usefull with such a
    device.<br>
    
    Once you manage to connect your GPS to Cumulus, select the correct
    device and baud rate in the <a
    href="cumulus-settings.html">settings dialog</a>. Refer to your
    GPS manual for the correct settings. For most serial devices,
    device <i>/dev/ttyS0</i> will do, for Compact Flash
    <i>/dev/ttyS3</i> is most common, but Cumulus can also detect the
    correct device for CF units automaticly if you choose the value
    <i>CF</i>. The default NMEA connection speed is 4800 bps.
    <br><br> Press <b><i>G</i></b> to check the GPS status.
   </dd>

  <dt><b>Maps</b></dt>
  
  <dd>
    Cumulus uses the same maps as <i>KFLog</i>, the KDE Flight Logger.
    Download the maps you need and install them on your PDA or on a
    CompactFlash, MultiMediaCard or SecureDigital Card. See <a
    href="cumulus-maps.html">maps</a> for more details on downloading
    and installing maps.
   </dd>
   
  <dt><b>Waypoints</b></dt>
  
  <dd>
    Cumulus uses waypoints to facilitate navigation. You can either
    edit waypoint files on the PDA or prepare them on the desktop
    using <i>KFLog</i> and transfer them to the PDA. See <a
    href="cumulus-waypoints.html">waypoints</a> for more details on
    waypoints.
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Tasks</b></dt>

  <dd>
    Cumulus supports also the definition of flight tasks. You can
    either edit the task file on the PDA or prepare them on the
    desktop using <i>KFLog</i> and transfer them to the PDA. See <a
    href="cumulus-preflight-settings-task.html">tasks</a>
    for more details on tasks.
